<h2><a name="Executive">Executive Summary</a></h2><br>

<h3>The Challenge of Modeling Climate</h3><br>
 
Understanding and predicting climate, particularly climate variation and
possible human-induced climate change, presents one of the most difficult and
urgent challenges in science.  Earth-system scientists worldwide responded to
that challenge over the past decade with a bewildering variety of climate
models, simple and complex, with coarse or fine resolution, covering few or
many aspects of the climate system, treating individual components or
fully-coupled systems, and implemented on every variety of computing system. 
This remarkable effort reveals two requirements for successful climate
modeling: full coupling of model components and extraordinary collaboration
among modelers.  Researchers probing the human genome benefit from a uniform
genetic code and widely available gene libraries --- their research community
benefits collectively from diverse individual accomplishments.  Similarly,
climate researchers need access to a uniform modeling framework and better
ways to share, compare, and incorporate diverse individual modeling advancements.
</p>
<h3>A Step Towards Community Climate Models</h3><br>
NCAR proposes to develop, maintain, and improve a comprehensive, fully-coupled
model of the climate system, one with a hierarchy of modular components within
a unified model framework, flexible enough for implementation on several
computing systems, and accessible to the climate modeling community.  (See
Chapter 1: Project Description)
</p>

<h3>Why NCAR?</h3><br>

NCAR starts with proven ability to produce and support community models and,
with external collaborators, has
skill in all major components of climate modeling and validation (Chapter
5: Component Models and Development Plans).  NCAR researchers and support
staff have a history of internal and external collaboration on coupled
modeling problems and of modeling projects supported by a variety of
government agencies (Chapter 4: Coupled Modeling and Climate Research at NCAR).</p>
<p> 
The NCAR climate modeling groups propose an immediate focus on a
climate system model (CSM).
</p>
<h3>A Start-Up Phase</h3><br>

This NCAR CSM plan proclaims an immediate goal of demonstrating the ability to
couple disparate component models.  To get started, the NCAR CSM has a
commitment of NCAR staff, some outside collaboration, a strategy for initial
calculations to test and develop prototype coupled models, and initial
computing resources.  The NCAR CSM needs a start-up phase of approximately two
years, to allow it to develop and test a framework that can eventually
support more broadly-based use and improvement (Chapter 1:  An NCAR
Climate System Model).  NCAR CSM will need
substantial additional computing resources during this start-up period. 
(Chapter 2: Start-Up Phase)
</p>

<h3>CSM Plans</h3><br>
The NCAR community CSM will adopt design criteria that allow implementation
and testing of a range of components and subcomponents developed within and
outside NCAR.  The CSM project will organize so as to encourage and foster
collaborations from university and federal laboratory researchers.  The CSM
project will adapt computing advances when appropriate and support
implementations of the model on massively parallel and moderately parallel
vector computing systems.  (For all the above, see Chapter 1: Project
Description.)  Finally, CSM researchers will focus on specific issues in the
component models that contribute to improvements in component and coupled
system performance leading to improved predictive understanding of climate.

(Chapter 3: Scientific Problems to be Addressed)
</p>

<h3>What Does the Research Community Get from a CSM at NCAR?</h3><br>


<p>
Climate researchers from universities, federal laboratories, the
private sector, and NCAR get modeling tools and a framework and computing
environment for using those tools.  They get access to a range of model
components to complement their own and a system in which to test their own
components in a variety of configurations.  Other coupled modeling efforts get
access to and benefit from an open modeling environment and the opportunity to
implement community CSM improvements in their own systems.  The climate
research community gets a much needed test bed, a way to incorporate and focus
diverse achievements, and a set of recognized, documented, advanced coupled
models to apply to national and international environmental policy issues. 
The climate impacts and policy research communities will have access to
the CSM process and will help guide CSM development.  
</p>






<b>I.</b> <b><u>An NCAR Climate System Model</u></b><br>

<a name="Overview">Overview</a><br>

<p>
Changes in climate, whether anthropogenic or natural, involve a
complex interplay of physical, chemical, and biological processes of
the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface.  As climate system research
seeks to explain the behavior of climate over time scales of years to
millennia, focus necessarily turns to behavior introduced by physical,
chemical, and biogeochemical interactions among climate
subsystems. The need to understand climate as a coupled system is
demonstrated by the paleoclimate record, which reveals large,
related changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation and
biogeochemistry (e.g., Broecker, 1987; Dansgaard et al., 1993).
The challenges of modeling the role of anthropogenic emissions of
carbon dioxide, of reactive trace gases, and of changing land use in
the earth system likewise require a coupled climate system approach.
While knowledge that land-ocean-atmosphere interactions influence
climate is not new, the emergence of coupled climate system questions
as central scientific concerns of geophysics constitutes a major
change in the research agendas of atmospheric science, oceanography,
ecology, and hydrology.
</p>

<p>
Two recent books, ``Climate System Modeling'' (Trenberth, 1992) and
``Modeling the Earth System'' (Ojima, 1992), document many aspects of
climate system modeling and of the uses of such models for global
change research and paleoclimate studies. Key questions include the
coupling between processes occurring at different time scales
(seasonal to interannual, interannual to decadal) that affect the
longer term behavior of the system. The interaction between seasonal
and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) processes discussed by
Tziperman et al.  (1994) and Jin
et al. (1994) provides one example. Evidence in the paleorecord
and from models that changes in ENSO frequency are a component of long-term
climate variability is a related but longer term example (Meehl
et al., 1993; Thompson et al., 1989). The possible
existence of thresholds or multiple equilibria in the climate system,
arising from the thermohaline ocean circulation and perhaps related to
the carbon cycle, is another issue of scientific importance and great
relevance to society (Taylor et al., 1993). Adaptation to
abrupt change would be more difficult than acclimatization
to continuous change. 
</p>

<p>
We believe that relatively simple models will continue to play an
important role in climate system research, but the most credible
characterizations of the important processes, as well as the best
predictions for future climate change, will come from comprehensive
models of the climate system.  Many relevant examples of component
subsystem models exist, and several groups around the world have
produced interesting prototypes for a comprehensive climate system
model.  However, no mature model of this type yet exists.  We believe
it timely to establish a substantial, highly-focussed project at NCAR
to develop, explore, test, and continuously improve a CSM.
Extrapolating from previous general circulation model (GCM) experience, we strongly believe this
project, and others like it, will require many years to come to
maturity, although a sequence of useful models and scientific results
will be produced over that period.
</p>

<p>
Development of a comprehensive CSM, which
accurately represents the principal components of the climate system
and the couplings between them, requires both wide intellectual
participation and computing capabilities beyond those available to
most U.S. institutions. A CSM, therefore, must involve an 
improved framework for coupling existing and future component models
to permit rapid exploration of alternate formulations, an 
accessible coupled model within that framework that allows
calculations at various complexities and resolutions according to
scientific need and demand on computing resources, and an active
series of simulations and evaluations using the improved model to
address important scientific issues and problems of national and
international policy interest.
</p>

<p>
There have been several coupled modeling studies over the last two
decades and an ongoing debate over criteria for ``state-of-the-art''
climate models. It has been argued (by S. Manabe of the Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), S. Schneider of Stanford/NCAR, among
others) that the choice of computational resolution involves
scientific assessments balanced by resource (computing) availability,
and that model skill in addressing specific scientific questions does
not automatically result from detailed parameterizations or high
resolution.  We extract two principles from that debate pertinent to
the development of a CSM.  First, science issues must drive model
development, although computing resources may force scientific
compromises and may severely limit the number of simulations that can
be performed. Second, the CSM development effort should not 
a priori eschew exploration of coupled behavior or solutions using
simple, less computationally intensive, component models.
</p>

<a name="Descr1"><u><b>NCAR CSM Project Description</a></b></u>

<p>
As a leading research institution in atmospheric science and
associated disciplines, NCAR has a long history of developing,
maintaining, and improving models of the atmosphere, ocean, and
land surface.  NCAR also pioneered basic studies of the earth
system that led to current understanding of the strength and pervasive
influence of land-ocean-atmosphere couplings on the climate system.
</p>

<p>
NCAR now plans to develop, maintain, and improve a comprehensive CSM.
We commit to designing a scientifically sound, policy-relevant
modeling system, accessible to a large user community. The CSM itself,
a hierarchy of simpler subset models, and the results of a wide
variety of experiments using the models will be available to NCAR,
university, and federal laboratory scientists, and to any other
interested parties. To ensure broad intellectual participation and
efficient use of resources, the effort to develop a CSM will be
coordinated and integrated across NCAR scientific divisions and the
NCAR Scientific Computing Division, and will collaborate extensively
with the university and federal laboratory research community.
</p>

<p>
As a focussed effort, the CSM project will address an important aspect
of climate system research. In particular, the CSM project is aimed at
developing and using comprehensive models to gain a predictive
understanding of  the climate system. Toward this end, the long-term
goals of the  CSM project are simple and ambitious. They are:<br>

<ul>
<li>to develop and maintain a comprehensive CSM that is at the forefront
of international efforts in modeling the climate system; 
<li>to maintain a hierarchy of less complete subset
models; 
<li>to continually improve the comprehensive model and its
component models;
<li>to use the model to address important scientific
questions about the climate system, including global change and
interdecadal and interannual variability;
<li>to use appropriate versions of the model for
calculations in support of national and international policy
decisions; and
<li>to make the complete hierarchy of models and the results of major
experiments available to the wider scientific community.
</ul>


<p>
Complementary efforts using simplified models are also important and will be
undertaken by many individuals, including CSM participants.
</p>

<a name="Components"><b><u>CSM Components and Structure</b></u></a>

<p>
The CSM will have a simple conceptual structure: separate models for
atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and sea ice that communicate through
a flux coupler. The flux coupler will impose few (if any) rules about
the resolutions and structures of component models. This structure
will easily allow for the distribution of the component models among
separate computers. This simple structure also allows the systematic
maintenance of a hierarchy of climate system models. For example, the
same structure can support alternative component models ranging
from specified boundary conditions to interactive GCMs on either side
of the atmosphere/ocean interface. The appropriate component models
and their configuration for a particular problem can then be selected
on the basis of the important processes expected to be involved.
</p>

<p>
The atmospheric component includes atmospheric dynamics, radiation,
clouds, aerosols, and chemistry; it encompasses the troposphere and at
least some (possibly large) portion of the middle atmosphere.  The
oceanic component includes ocean dynamics and biochemistry. For
efficient modeling the ocean component supports different domains:
regional or global and upper-ocean or full-depth.  The land surface
component includes physical, biological, and chemical processes; it
extends from the top of the plant canopy through the upper soil layers.
The sea ice component includes the dynamics and thermodynamics of sea
ice formation and transport.  The flux coupler is a separate computer
code that interrogates components for state variables, calculates
interfacial fluxes not produced by component models, and parcels out
fluxes in an integrally-conservative manner, even when component
models have different space-time discretizations.  The flux coupler
will also control the synchronization and pace of calculations.
</p>

<a name="Analogy"><b><u>The CCM Analogy</b></u></a>

<p>
The NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM) represents a successful example
of an institutional modeling project.  Many of its attributes should
belong to the CSM:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is maintained as a community model, available to NCAR,
university, and federal laboratory scientists who invest effort to
learn about it and obtain computer time to use it;

<li>Its development and evaluation occurs through an open process
that includes all interested scientists, but is accomplished in
practice primarily by a relatively small team of scientists who make a
substantial commitment of their time, cooperate closely, and take
responsibility for the model's contents;

<li>Its development is guided and overseen by an internal advisory
committee that meets frequently, an external panel of experts that
meets approximately annually, and occasional workshops for users;

<li>Its code architecture and formats support modular subcomponents and
portability to different computers and centers;

<li>Benchmark versions of the model are produced on explicitly
declared (and approximately met) schedules; and

<li>The project commands resources, particularly in support staff and
computer allocations, greater than those typically available to
individual scientists.
</ul>

<a name="Criteria"><b><u>CSM Design Criteria</b></u></a>

<p>
The scientific scope of the CSM project is much greater than the scope
of the CCM.  In consequence, the CSM will be more complex than the
CCM, and the CSM project will need to support much broader user communities
than does the CCM. The CSM should also stand as a more nearly unique
model.  A few modeling groups have expertise that spans the climate
system; however, in the U.S. none are institutionally committed to
full community access to its models and computing environment.  In its
more complete configurations, CSM will require long
integration times and computing resources substantially larger than
those now available. To obtain the maximum benefit from the available
scientific and computational resources, the CSM project will adhere to
the following design criteria:
</p>

<p>
Establish a unified model framework.  The CSM will establish a unified
model framework, albeit one with flexibility and generality. When
alternative component models exist or develop, the
CSM project will endeavor to incorporate the best aspects of each in
the unified model. However, the CSM will have to run on several
different computer systems, and it is possible that separate
implementations of some component models will have to be maintained
for both massively parallel computers and moderately parallel vector
computers. 
</p>

<p>
Support variable domains, resolutions, and complexity.  The CSM
must support various domains and resolutions to allow locally
high-resolution  studies of specific problems or regions and to allow
relatively low-resolution for long time scale (century and longer)
studies. A hierarchy of components must be supported with, for
example, different levels of physical or chemical complexity. The
combination of the components for particular coupled calculations must
be easily user selectable.
</p>

<p>
Support modular components.  Component models should interact
with the CSM in a modular way, so that scientists can experiment with
alternative component models.  Modularity offers the potential for
fruitful cooperation with other groups pursuing climate system
modeling.
</p>

<p>
Develop from existing components.  In principle, CSM might wish to design
entirely new component models, subject to all available advice.  In
practice, several CSM component models will grow from existing models.
The CSM atmospheric physical model will start from CCM2.  The first
realization of the CSM oceanic physical model will derive from a
GFDL-type ocean model.  Other CSM component models have, a priori,
less obvious initial design bases.
</p>

<p>
Begin with some components simplified.  To efficiently explore
new modes of solution behavior that occur with coupled component
models, CSM calculations should begin with at least some components
intentionally very simple.
</p>

<p>
Use computational science advances.  To achieve the design
criteria listed (modularity, variable domains, resolutions, and
complexity, and selectable combinations of coupled components) and to
support CSM on a wide range of computer systems, CSM must attend
closely to code architectural aspects and other computational science
issues.  CSM teams should include computational science expertise.
</p>


<a name="Validation"><b><u>CSM Analysis and Validation</b></u></a>

<p>
Developing CSM and its components invokes a vital, ongoing need to
judge how well the models perform, to diagnose erroneous performance,
to improve those aspects or components deemed inadequate, and
generally to document and validate the model. In carrying out these tasks,
close collaboration with mathematicians and statisticians is essential.
Even for individual model
components, natural variability of the model may obscure the signals
one seeks in the model solution.  In the case of CSM, the scope of
possible natural variability becomes much greater and less well 
documented, so validation presents a severe problem. 
</p>

<p>
The lack of complete, global observations of many important variables and
derived quantities presents major challenges to validation of component models
of the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice.  In coupled models, concern with
interactive system behavior exacerbates validation problems. However,
a great deal of data is available that provides
indirect information about aspects of the coupled system. For example,
heat and fresh water budget constraints 
can be used to validate coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice components. 
Estimates of evaporation minus precipitation from atmospheric measurements or
analyses can be used to examine fresh water transports, oceanic
salinity, and thermohaline circulation.  Similarly, the sum of convergence of heat
transports by atmosphere and ocean must balance net radiation imbalances at
the top-of-the-atmosphere.  The combination of local budgets of these
quantities in the atmosphere, the ocean, and at the interface produces
over-specification requiring conciliation among different answers and, thus,
provides constraints on system behavior.  In the absence of sufficient quality
observational data, these multiple internal checks will need to be extensively
exploited.
</p>

<p>
Because requisite data sets may not exist or may exist in unusable
forms, CSM development activities will connect closely with data base
development and validation efforts across the community to make known
the data needs of the CSM effort. A start in this direction is already 
underway within SCD and CGD, working collaboratively with universities
and NOAA under the U.S. Global Change Research Program's Geosystem
Database initiative.
</p>


<a name="Computing"><b><u>CSM Computing</b></u></a>

<p>
The computational requirements of a comprehensive CSM are enormous and
will require dedicated, up-to-date computer facilities. Inevitably,
the development of CSM will require undesirable trade-offs between
computational expense, resolution, and detailed treatments of
physical, chemical, and biological processes.  Incorporation of
chemical and biogeochemical cycles will greatly increase the cost over
that for the physical climate system alone.  If the CSM project is to
provide a truly state-of the-art model to the scientific community, it
is imperative that the computational constraints not force excessive
compromise.
</p>

<p>
There must be sufficient computer power available to simultaneously
support: ongoing development of the coupled model and of the
underlying component models; long (at least century) production
integrations of the comprehensive coupled model; and decadal
integrations of higher resolution, less comprehensive coupled
models. Experience suggests that it will not be possible to maintain
interest and participation in the CSM project if it is necessary to
stop development  to make long production simulations, or if
the production simulations take many months each to complete.
</p>

<p>
The initial CSM computing requirements are being addressed through the
Climate Simulation Laboratory (CSL) within the NCAR Scientific Computing
Division. As of October, 1994, the CSL consists of 5 Cray Research
Inc. computers, a
YMP8-864, a 64 processor T3D, and three EL98's.
These machines will meet the requirements of
the CSM in the short term, and will allow reasonable resolution in the
atmosphere and ocean components of the physical climate system. They
will not be adequate to allow routine inclusion of chemical and
biogeochemical cycles in the CSM for long integrations, and they are,
in total, less powerful than the computers available at several
climate research centers internationally. Substantially augmenting the
initial CSL computers will be required if the CSM is to include
chemistry and biogeochemistry and is to be widely used by the scientific
community in the U.S.
</p>

<a name="Organization"><b><u>CSM Project Organization</b></u></a>

<p>
The CSM project will be overseen by a steering committee consisting of
the NCAR director, associate director, and the directors of the
science divisions. Guidance and oversight will also come from the
Scientific Advisory Committee for the National Science Foundation
(NSF) Climate Modeling,  Analysis and
Prediction (CMAP) program (see appendix, section VIII). Scientific direction of CSM
will come primarily from the CSM Investigator Group (CSMIG), composed
of those NCAR and outside scientists actively participating in CSM. It
is expected that the composition of this group will vary with time as
some participants move on to other interests and new investigators
become involved. The Chair of the CSMIG is appointed by the NCAR
director in consultation with the CSMIG. During the start-up phase of
CSM, Byron Boville and William Holland are co-chairing the CSMIG.
</p>

<p>
The CSMIG co-chairs will lead the collaborating team of scientists
involved in the project. They will maintain a consensual, decision
making approach and will attempt to resolve scientific debate within
the project in a constructive fashion. They will describe and advocate
the CSM project in a variety of venues, including at scientific
meetings and at funding agency briefings. They will coordinate, and be
responsible for, the development of plans and proposals. They will
attempt to engage the participation of a broad spectrum of scientists
in the CSM project.  They will allocate the resources available to the
project (including computer time and programming support) in
consultation with the CSMIG.
</p>

<p>
CSM activities described in this plan will occur largely through the
efforts of relatively small teams of scientists. These teams will work
on component models and on coupling strategies, and all team members
will be members of the CSMIG.  Each team takes responsibility for
developing and continually improving its component of the CSM
consistent with the CSM goal of a fully-coupled model and with the CSM
design criteria.  Each team will declare its development priorities
and work schedules.  During the CSM start-up phase, CSM teams will
consist largely, though not entirely, of NCAR scientists.  The
eventual success of the long-term CSM effort requires full and active
participation by non-NCAR researchers as CSM members and an
active effort to develop and maintain close collaborations over
considerable distances.
</p>


<b>II.</b> <a name="Start"><b><u>CSM Start-up Phase</u></b></a><br>

<p>
The complexity of climate issues and the evident and as-yet
undiscovered difficulties in designing, assembling, and testing a
coupled climate system model require that the CSM project adopt and
adhere to long-term goals and standards. Within and consistent with
that long-term effort, we defined a start-up phase of approximately two
years that began in January, 1994. We recognize the need to show
sufficient progress and skill so that, by the end of the start-up
phase, the CSM can serve as the centerpiece for a long-term community
climate modeling research program and as a useful tool for addressing
policy-driven questions about climate change.  During this phase, CSM
development will rely heavily on people and climate modeling research
now underway at NCAR, coordinated toward the CSM goals and
supplemented in many instances by direct solicitation of university
and federal laboratory collaborators. Outside guidance and oversight
will come from the Scientific Advisory Committee of CMAP.
</p>

<p>
During the start-up phase, the prototype CSM will be developed, tested,
and probably revised extensively. Development of the prototype model
is already proceeding, with initial coupled atmosphere-ocean
calculations having begun in April, 1994. The initial release of the
CSM for wider use by the scientific community will take place at the
end of the start-up phase.  The highest priority
short-term goals of the CSM project are:
to develop a global coupled atmosphere, ocean, land surface, sea
ice model from existing component models;
to determine the ability of the model to reproduce the current
climate, including interannual and interdecadal variability;
to attempt to significantly reduce the largest errors of the
initial coupled model; 
to use the resulting model for global change studies, including
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global warming scenarios;
to develop a hierarchy of subset models for addressing specific
problems on shorter time scales, e.g., a global atmosphere coupled to a
tropical Pacific upper ocean model to address the ENSO-related variability; and to couple carbon and sulfur cycle models into the CSM.
</p>

<p>
There are also several lower priority goals that the CSM will
actively address, largely taking advantage of
existing efforts and interests in specific areas. These lower priority
goals address problems that will be important to the CSM project in
the longer term and will entrain wider participation in the early
stages of CSM development without significantly impacting the highest
priority projects. These goals include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>development of a middle atmosphere GCM including interactive ozone chemistry; and 

<li>coupling of an upper atmosphere model to the lower atmosphere of the
CSM for studies of the interaction of the lower atmosphere with the
mesosphere and thermosphere.
</ul>

<p>
At the end of the CSM start-up phase, we intend to have publishable
solutions for a variety of coupled phenomena (see below); to have a
set of models that can be used for climate system research by a broad
segment of the scientific community; and to be in a position to
contribute to the scientific basis of national and international
policy discussions relating to global change by running scenarios for
changes in greenhouse gases. The models available at the end of the
start-up phase will serve as the basis for continuing development
based on the research interests of the expanding user base.
</p>

<a name="Strategy"><b><u>Strategy for Coupled Calculations</b></u></a>

<p>
According to the design criteria of the previous section, CSM will
develop from existing components and attempt, during initial
calculations, to couple those components in somewhat simplified form.
In choosing initial calculations, we attend to the need
to demonstrate that the CSM project has: engaged the active
collaboration of a wide selection of scientists; developed a viable
approach to building a CSM; and demonstrated substantial progress in
learning about coupled behavior during the CSM start-up phase.  Our
work on these particular initial calculations will allow us to meet
those needs and lead to more complex and comprehensive coupling
efforts as skill develops.
</p>

<p>
We propose the following strategy for selecting and conducting initial
calculations:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Work on coupled problems in parallel with work on component
models, testing the latter at least partly in uncoupled mode;

<li>Attempt to remove as many biases as possible in the surface
exchanges of energy and momentum of component models in uncoupled mode;

<li>Start with equilibrium climate as our principal target problem 
to address climate drift of the coupled system from the beginning;

<li>Start with primarily physical coupling and rapidly work toward
including chemical, biogeochemical, and ecological aspects;

<li>Define our target resolution as the maximum computationally-feasible resolution
over the next two years for coupled simulations of at least 100 years.
<li>Evaluate the benefits of this target resolution compared to lower
resolutions in the face of vastly increased costs for high resolution;
and 

<li>Sustain effort on several specific problems motivated by particular
scientific issues rather than emphasizing repeated calculations of just one
comprehensive problem.
</ul>
</p>


<p>
The initial CSM calculations have been selected according to the above
guidelines and computational constraints imposed by the phased
upgrades planned for the CSL. Extensive
coupled calculations could not begin prior to the availability of
a YMP8 in October, 1994. However, a great deal has been accomplished
in the interim period.
</p>


<u><b><a name="Development">Preliminary Development</a></u></b>

<p>The first nine months of the CSM project (January--September, 1994)
has been a 
preliminary development phase. During this phase several activities
have taken place:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Configure and test an updated atmosphere model based on CCM2;

<li>
Configure and spin up the ocean GCM;

<li>
Compare the ocean heat transport simulated by the ocean model to
the implied ocean heat transport in the atmosphere model with observed
sea-surface temperatures. The implied ocean heat transport is the
transport that would be required to maintain the fixed sea-surface
temperatures against the simulated surface fluxes;

<li>
Complete the implementation and testing of the prototype flux coupler;

<li>
Run the atmosphere model driven by the flux coupler with
observed sea-surface temperatures instead of an ocean model;

<li>Run the ocean model driven by the flux coupler and state
variables from the previous simulation with the atmosphere model;

<li>
Run the atmosphere model driven by the flux coupler and
sea-surface temperatures of the previous simulation with the ocean
model; and 

<li>
Begin low-resolution coupled simulation (R15 atmosphere, ocean and sea ice).
</ul>

<p><b><u><a name="Calculations">Initial Calculations</a></u></b></p>

<p>
The CSM coupled calculations during the start-up phase will focus on
two problems, equilibrium climate and seasonal to interannual
variability. The first problem forms the basis for all climate change
experiments, including greenhouse gas induced global warming, and
consequently for contributions to the IPCC process. It also supports
the modeling component of focus 2 of the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP) CLIVAR program. The
second problem contributes to the modeling component of CLIVAR focus 1
and the GOALS program in the U.S.
</p>

<p><i>Equilibrium Climate</i></p>

<p>
This is the essential problem to be addressed during the start-up
phase of the CSM project.  This calculation addresses the question of
whether the improvements that have been made in the atmosphere and
ocean model components over the last several years are sufficient to
allow coupled simulations that do not drift greatly from the
presently observed climate. Extensive analysis of the simulated annual
cycle and interannual variability will be required. We intend to run
the coupled model without ``flux adjustment'' at the atmosphere-ocean
interface. Based on previous experience at NCAR and elsewhere, it is
expected that the initial coupled calculation will drift away from the
present climate and that several revisions of 
the atmosphere and ocean models will be required. We will not resort to
``flux adjustment'' unless it is absolutely required to
produce a usable model within the two year start-up phase.
</p>

<p>
This problem presents an excellent first test to CSM because it is the
prerequisite to all global change experiments and to interdecadal
variability studies. Although later revisions of the CSM will be
integrated for a least 100 years, integrations of a decade or
so will probably be sufficient to establish the initial drift of the
early experiments.
</p>

<p>
Given this physical model as a base, we can investigate additional
phenomena with developmental, partially-coupled models on the same
space and time scales: (a) stratospheric ozone cycle; (b) tropospheric
sulfur cycle; (c) carbon cycle with terrestrial ecosystems and an
abiotic ocean; (d) oceanic primary productivity and phytoplankton
distributions with a nitrogen based marine ecosystem model; and (e)
lower atmospheric driving (one-way coupling) of the upper atmosphere.
Terrestrial and ocean biogeochemical models will be added as
diagnostic components to the physical models at an early stage.  The
research plans for the component models provide descriptions
of the approaches to these additional calculations.
</p>

<p>
Component models: </p>

<ul>
<li>
Atmosphere model based on CCM2 with many improvements to its
numerical formulation and physical parameterizations;

<li>
Land surface (biophysical exchange) model (Bonan, 1994);

<li>
Full-depth, ocean with isopycnal tracer mixing;

<li>
Flato-Hibler sea ice with extended thermodynamics (snow, etc.);
and 

<li>
Prototype flux coupler for ocean, ice, and marine atmosphere. The
variables exchanged and the exchange protocols have been
established and the prototype coupler is complete.
</ul>


<p><i>Initial conditions:</i></p>

<p>
Atmosphere and land initial conditions will come from an uncoupled CCM2
solution.  Ocean initial conditions will derive from a near-equilibrium
solution calculated with a full-depth ocean model using mean seasonal forcing
of climatological wind stress and temperature and salinity boundary
conditions that restore towards climatology.  
The ocean will then be run for several decades using boundary
conditions from the atmosphere model to yield initial conditions for
the coupled model.
</p>

<p><i>Issues:</i></p>

<p>
The target resolutions for this calculation are T42 for the atmosphere
(18 levels) and  for the ocean (45 levels) and ice
components. Alternative resolutions are also being explored and
the benefits of the target resolution will have to be established. The
duration of the initial calculations and the criteria for validation
have not yet been established.  We expect to resolve these issues
quickly. However, the availability of computer time will inevitably
play an important role in the choices made.  We will improve the
quality of the solution iteratively through successive integrations
and explore several alternative choices.
</p>

<p><i>Seasonal to Interannual Variability</i></p>

<p>
We will design seasonal and interannual calculations to address the
mechanisms responsible
for the coherent, coupled variations of the ocean and atmosphere on
seasonal and interannual time scales.  Such variations will include ENSO,
midlatitude ocean-atmosphere fluctuations, and variability in the thermohaline
circulation. We will use the ocean model in different configurations
to address the different phenomena mentioned above. For example, to address 
ENSO the ocean model will require resolution sufficient to resolve
important frontal structures and wave dynamics in the equatorial region. 
To address midlatitude ocean-atmosphere fluctuations, for example in the
North Atlantic region, the ocean model will 
require eddy-resolving resolution in the North Atlantic Ocean and 
coarser (non-eddy-resolving) resolution elsewhere in the global ocean. 
The sea ice component will also be configured appropriately for different 
phenomena; i.e., it is not important to ENSO variability but it is absolutely
vital to studies of variability in the thermohaline circulation. Eventually
it will be possible to have a truly eddy-resolving global ocean model as
part of the CSM, but this will require much greater computational resources.
</p>

<p>
The CCM2 and land models will be run with sufficiently high resolution
(T42 or higher for these studies), and the prototype flux coupler for
ocean, ice, and marine atmosphere will also be used. The flux coupler
approach allows regional ocean models to be combined with observations
from the rest of the ocean in an easy and consistent way. The initial
conditions for these various studies will also be chosen according to
the phenomena being addressed.
</p>


<b>III.</b> <b><u>CSM Phase II</u></b><br>

<b><a name="Community">
Making CSM Available to the Climate Modeling Community</a></b>

<p>
At the end of the startup phase, a CSM version 1 will be frozen and
documented extensively. The source code and accompanying technical
descriptions and users guides and the results of control and
greenhouse gas scenario experiments will be made available to the
scientific community. Plans are still being developed for the
distribution and support of the CSM and for fostering the continuing
involvement of an active user community in the ongoing
development and use of the CSM. These plans will be completed in
consultation with the Scientific Advisory Committee for CMAP and will
depend on the availability of resources to support the CSM. 
This work will require the efforts of a
dedicated core group of programmers as well as the input from NCAR
scientists, patterned after the successful development and application
of the CCM atmospheric model and its easy availability to the outside
community. The personnel requirements will be discussed in Section VI.
Here we will discuss some aspects of how the NCAR CSM activities relate to
the wider climate modeling community.
</p>

<p>
The model will be used by CSM investigators (from within and outside
NCAR) to address a wide variety of scientific problems. The CSM will
also be freely available to any interested parties, whether or not
they desire any further involvement with the onging CSM
project. Experience with the CCM suggests that to foster maximal use
and benefit from this new tool for climate studies, NCAR will
need to not only make the basic CSM model easily available, but to
supply documentation and other support to outside users. Thus the CSM
will be made available at the appropriate time by anonymous FTP,
extensive documentation of the code will be provided, workshops will
be undertaken by NCAR to actively aid a users group, and a
visitor/postdoc program will be supported at a level depending upon
resources.  Following the CCM experience, a first workshop in the
summer of 1996 (and one every two years thereafter) would allow a
rapid dissemination of knowledge and expertise on how to use the model
to the outside community of users.
</p>

<p>
Development and support of analysis tools will also be a vital part of
the CSM project and will be required by outside users in addition to
the CSM itself. Experience with the CCM indicates that support of
large analysis package across the widely distributed and diverse
computing environments of the CSM users would be a major
undertaking. Such a project would probably be beyond the resources
likely to be available to the CSM project and would probably not
lead to a product satisfactory to a large number of the CSM users in
any case. Plans for CSM analysis tools are still being developed, and
will evolve with user needs, but will probably focus on standardizing
data formats to those supported by many analysis and visualization packages
(e.g. netCDF). Widely available commercial and public domain software
packages could then be used to analyze CSM results.  A set of
tools to manipulate the data files and visualize the results will be
developed, in large part as modules within existing software packages.
</p>

<p>
There are already strong links between NCAR modeling activities and the
outside community. Many scientists at NCAR have very active
collaborations with the university community and close involvement
with activities in other agencies and programs supporting climate
research [DOE (CHAMMP, LLNL, LANL); EPA (GENESIS); NASA (EOS, GSFC, JPL,
WSRP); NOAA (Climate data reanalysis)]. Discussions on
cooperation between CSM and some of these programs have already
started. Thus it is expected that
involving the outside community in CSM will occur naturally and
rapidly in the early stages of CSM development and use.
Almost half of the planned CSM budget will be used for short and long
term visitors, postdoctoral fellows, and workshops.
</p>

<p><b>
<a name="Problems">Scientific Problems to be Addressed by CSM</a></b></p>

<p>
Several important scientific problems require a CSM
beyond the scope of existing NCAR models and include models of
physical, chemical, and biological processes that transcend
disciplinary boundaries. The CSM project will not only develop the model
and make it available, but will also use the CSM and its subset models
to address many of these problems. Examples, roughly in order of
priority to the CSM project, include:
</p>

<p>
Equilibrium physical climate. The first priority of the CSM
project is to develop a model that more accurately represents the
current state of the physical climate system, including its mean state
and annual and interannual variability. This is required for
increasing confidence in global change studies. Simulating the present
climate requires coupled climate system models, including the
atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and sea ice. It is the starting point
for studies of chemical and biogeochemical cycles.
</p>

<p>
Global warming.  The possibility of significant global warming
motivates much research on the climate system.  Determining the extent
of greenhouse gas warming, the impacts of warming on other aspects of
climate (precipitation, solar radiation at the land surface), and the
spatial variability of warming effects require coupled climate system
models.  Determining the time evolution of greenhouse effects also
requires coupled models: it depends
upon the complex behavior of the coupled systems (e.g., land, carbon cycle,
ocean). NCAR has a long history of global warming research and
participates in IPCC simulations with coupled models.
</p>

<p>
Comprehensive annual cycle.  Simulation of temporal and spatial
components of the annual cycle presents a demanding and attractive
test to coupled models.  Simulation of the annual cycle
involves all aspects of the climate system (atmospheric physics and
chemistry, the hydrologic cycle, ocean dynamics, and
biology/biophysics) but without important and difficult longer term
processes of deep ocean circulation, vegetation change, and carbon
cycle dynamics.  Accurate annual cycle simulations should include
physical climatology and annual cycles of important trace gases
(O, CH, CO) and of terrestrial characteristics, such as
soil moisture and leaf area.
</p>

<p>
Interannual variability. Interannual variability on time scales
of a few years involves interactions of the atmosphere and the land
surface through changes in surface wetness and snow cover. Sea ice
variations are also important. However, interactions of the atmosphere
and the upper ocean, particularly the tropical oceans, may be of
dominant importance on this time scale. Studies on this time scale
will require more detailed upper ocean models than will be used for
equilibrium climate interdecadal variability. The CSM project
begins with a solid base of experience in coupling atmospheric and
tropical upper ocean models, in coupling atmosphere and land surface
models, and in coupling atmospheric and global ocean models.
</p>

<p>
Interdecadal variability.  Detecting long-term climate change requires an
understanding of climate variability on decadal time scales.
Interdecadal variability can be forced by processes external to the
atmosphere-ocean-land-ice system, such as volcanic emissions, solar
variability, and anthropogenic effects.  However, interdecadal
variability is also an intrinsic aspect of the
atmosphere-ocean-land-ice system, resulting from internal dynamics in
the atmosphere and from atmospheric interactions with oceans and land.
For example, interdecadal variabilities in land, ocean, and
atmosphere systems probably play roles in Sahelian drought cycles,
monsoon variations, and other low-frequency phenomena.
</p>

<p>
Sulfur cycle.  Climate researchers have long recognized the importance of
sulfate aerosols in climate, and this problem has recently returned to
the forefront of scientific interest.  Studies of sulfur effects require that
coupled models include elements of tropospheric chemistry and represent
anthropogenic and biological controls over tropospheric SO and NH
concentrations and vertical distributions within the coupled physical climate
system. 
</p>

<p>
Carbon cycle.  Understanding the role of the carbon cycle in the
climate system presents a major scientific and practical challenge to
earth and life sciences. Only coupled models can consider the full
range of factors influencing the carbon cycle: human land use,
CO-fertilized growth in regrowing and natural areas, climate
feedbacks to ecosystems, and climate effects on carbon storage through
physical and biological processes. The CSM effort begins an
essentially new effort in this area, but one that starts from
existing strengths in modeling terrestrial carbon dynamics and in
tracer transport in the atmosphere and ocean (e.g., Schimel et al., 1994;
Erickson et al., 1994).
</p>

<p>
Middle atmosphere circulation and ozone depletion. Catalytic ozone
destruction caused by anthropogenic gases is one of the key global
change problems. Until recently, most modeling of ozone chemistry and
transport has taken place using two-dimensional models (in the
latitude-height plane). It is now generally recognized that several
key transport processes require a three-dimensional model to treat
them credibly (e.g., convection, stratosphere-troposphere
exchange).  NCAR has existing expertise in modeling dynamics and
transport in the middle atmosphere (Boville, 1991; Rasch et al., 1993)
and in modeling ozone chemistry (Brasseur et al., 1990). Work on a
coupled dynamical-photochemical model for ozone has already
started. Eventually, global warming problems may be treated with an
interactive ozone chemistry component, although these problems will be
treated separately in the early stages of the CSM project, and the
ozone chemistry will be done in models without an interactive ocean.
</p>

<p>
Glacial-interglacial transitions.  There is conflicting
observational evidence suggesting that transitions between extreme
climate conditions (e.g., between ice ages and warmer interglacial
periods) can occur on short, perhaps even decadal, time scales with
several transitions within the span of a few centuries.  Investigating
such phenomena requires a reasonably complete and skillful model of the
coupled climate system. This is a long-term goal of CSM and will 
be an active area of research in the later stages of the project.
</p>

<p><b><a name="Further">Further Developments</a></b></p>

<p>
The particular model components that comprise the CSM at the start of
phase II are being selected by NCAR scientists and a small number of
external collaborators. These choices depend on a number of factors,
including, but not limited to, scientific merit.
</p>

<p>
NCAR management and CSM scientists are committed to the principle of
continuous evaluation of the CSM and its components, and the
replacement of existing components with others, from wherever, that
are of higher scientific quality. This commitment includes the task
of defining a process for such evaluations. 
</p>


<b>IV.</b> <b><u>Coupled Modeling and Climate Research at NCAR</u></b>

<a name="Coupled">Coupled Modeling Background</a><br>


<p>
While component models for the atmosphere and ocean have been
available for some years, and at least partial land models for nearly
as long, relatively few coupled simulations have been conducted. The
rate of progress has been retarded by the difficulties of coupling
models, by persistent problems with coupled simulations (e.g.,
``climate drift''), and by the lack of adequate computing resources at
every major institution involved in such calculations. In view of the
level of effort involved in developing coupled models and of the
resources required to run them, it is important to learn as much as
possible from existing and planned calculations.
</p>

<p>
The first coupled ocean-atmosphere model calculations (see review by
Meehl, 1990) were conducted at GFDL in the late 1960's with a simple
sector model (Manabe and Bryan, 1969).  That group continued coupled
model development through the 1970's leading to a global
ocean-atmosphere coarse grid model with asynchronous coupling (Manabe
et al., 1975; Bryan et al., 1975).
</p>

<p>
The first global coupled ocean-atmosphere-sea ice model calculation at
NCAR also used asynchronous coupling in light of limited computing
resources (Washington et al., 1980).  Several other groups
began global coarse grid coupled modeling activities in the 1980's
(e.g., Max Planck Institute in Germany, the Hadley Centre in England).
A transient CO increase calculation performed by researchers at
NCAR with a global coupled coarse grid model
(Washington and Meehl, 1989) was one of several model simulations that
contributed to the IPCC reports (IPCC, 1990, 1992).  In that model 
earlier results performed with simple sector coupled models were
confirmed in that the oceanic thermohaline circulation weakened with increased
CO in the atmosphere.  Similar results with a global coupled
coarse grid model were documented about the same time by researchers
at GFDL (Stouffer et al., 1989).  A streamlined version of the
GFDL global coarse grid coupled model has recently been run for
several 500-year integrations to document century time scale
variability of the thermohaline circulation with various CO
increase scenarios (Manabe and Stouffer, 1993). The results show a
suppression of the thermohaline circulation, which appears to be
irreversible in the highest CO scenario.
</p>

<p>
Currently, Washington and Meehl are running a global coupled model
with increased ocean resolution (, 20 levels).  Control and
transient CO increase experiments are being performed with and
without flux correction.  This coupled model will be used to simulate
the effects of IPCC CO scenarios on climate processes and to study
further inherent variability in the coupled system on various
time scales. While this experiment will be conducted outside the CSM
flux coupler framework, it will include CCM2, a CSM component.  The
study will be a useful reference point for the subsequent development
and testing of the flux coupler concept described below.  The NCAR
contribution to the current IPCC 1995 assessment will be based on the
above experiments, and contributions to subsequent assessments will be
based on the new coupled model described in this document.
</p>

<a name="Contributing">Contributing Research</a><br>

<p>
The focussed research within the CSM project is built upon a general
base of NSF-funded climate research at NCAR, as well as several closely
affiliated climate modeling projects funded by other agencies.  The
scope and quality of this research are greatly enhanced by extensive
collaborations with university and federal laboratory scientists.
</p>

<p>
A large part of the climate research at NCAR takes place within the
Climate and Global Dynamics Division (CGD). The broad research
objectives of CGD are to promote further understanding of the physical
causes of present and past climates and of large-scale atmospheric and
oceanic dynamics, thus contributing to the basis for the scientific
prediction of weather and climate.  During the last few years, CGD has
engaged in the following research activities geared toward achieving
these objectives: (1) release of CCM2 to the scientific community; (2) investigation, with the
CCM and other models, of the mechanisms of global climate variability
and change and
exploration of the basis for long-range prediction of weather and
climate; (3) study of the dynamics of global oceans and interactions
with the atmosphere; (4) evaluation and analysis of global
observational data sets for the study of climate variability and
validation of climate models; (5) study and modeling of clouds, their
radiative properties, and their effects on global energy balance from
satellite observations; (6) description and modeling of the interface
between the atmosphere and the oceans, cryosphere, chemosphere, and
land--biosphere within the concept of coupled climate systems; (7)
examination of the mesoscale implications of large-scale climate
changes; and (8) study of the relationship between ecosystem processes
and the atmosphere.  The CSM project will draw upon this ongoing
research for many of its modeling components, as well as analysis and
validation of simulations with observations.
</p>

<p>
NCAR scientists have continued development of, and research with, the
Global Environmental and Ecological Simulations of Interactive Systems
(GENESIS) earth system model.  The GENESIS model is designed to
facilitate research in terrestrial surface processes and
paleoclimate.  Part of this research supports the Paleoclimate of
Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE) program.  The current GENESIS model
(version 1.02) has been in use since January, 1992, by a number of
groups within and outside NCAR.  This work has been supported by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
</p>

<p>
The climate sensitivity to increased CO work of Washington and Meehl,
described above, is supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) Global Change
Research Program.
The development of versions of the CCM and other
climate modules for a variety of massively parallel processor
computers is being pursued with funding from the Computer Hardware,
Advanced Mathematics and Model Physics (CHAMMP) program (DOE).  Also
under CHAMMP is the development of a semi-Lagrangian version of the
CCM2 and a simplified, workstation-based, numerical framework for
parameterization development, as well as benchmark models for testing
numerical methods.  Important studies in radiation and clouds using a
two-dimensional cumulus ensemble model continue with support from the
Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) program, also funded by DOE.
In addition, scientists continue to participate in the Atmospheric
Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) sponsored by the Environmental
Sciences Division of DOE.
</p>

<p>
A modeling component, especially with regard to land surface
processes, terrestrial ecosystems, and the
use of satellite data for validation, is  included in an interdisciplinary
project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA)
Earth Observing System (EOS). The latter also supports
satellite and other data set development for use with models and development
of an adjoint model for examining sensitivity to input data and
parameterizations. Further, EOS funding supports the development of ecosystem
dynamics modeling for use in global applications and coupled earth system
modeling of the carbon cycle. 
</p>

<p>
Several NCAR projects are supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's (NOAA) Office of Global Programs under the
Climate and Global Change Program that help develop the ocean component of
climate models, explore coupling atmospheric and ocean models
especially for ENSO studies, and explore processes important in
interannual and low-frequency variability. In addition, NCAR scientists
are working collaboratively with NOAA in the production of reanalyzed
long-term climate data sets.
</p>

<p>
The Japanese Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI)
helps support development of a high-resolution regional climate model
RegCM2 that can be driven by global analyses as boundary conditions.  Also
contributing is the Italian Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Environment
(ENEA) by supporting regional climate modeling, studies of coupled
ocean-atmospheric forcing, and the effects of resolving boundary features in
global warming scenarios.  Other support in providing computer time for climate
modeling has come from the Model Evaluation Consortium for Climate
Assessment (MECCA).
</p>

<p>
NCAR scientists participate in many national and international
programs that are also relevant to CSM.  Our participation in the CMAP
program, Global Tropospheric Chemistry Program (GTCP), Tropical Ocean
and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) and the TOGA Coupled Ocean--Atmosphere
Response Experiment (TOGA COARE), World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE) especially through the WOCE Community Modeling Effort (CME),
Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), Role of Clouds, Energy and
Water (ROCEW)/Global Energy and Water cycle Experiment (GEWEX),
Atlantic Climate Change Program (ACCP), and International Satellite Cloud
Climatology Project (ISCCP) is strong evidence of our contribution to
the U.S. Global Change Research Program.  Efforts are ongoing in
Geosystems Databases and data reanalysis with the development,
documentation, analyses, verification, and distribution of data sets
to a wide user community.
</p>

<p>
The core NCAR NSF support, together with other agency funding for specific
projects, provides a strong base for the NCAR CSM. University and
federal laboratory scientists
will contribute to the effort by collaborating with NCAR scientists or as
independent investigators. The results of
applications of the models through these efforts are expected to feed
into the CSM, while the CSM develops new modules and models that can
be employed and exploited by these efforts.  The CSM will also draw
upon the diverse activities ongoing within CGD, the Atmospheric
Chemistry Division (ACD), the Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology
Division (MMM), and the High Altitude Observatory (HAO), thus
providing opportunities for alternate model components to the CSM.
Through its various versions, the CSM will eventually be tailored to
such specific problems as droughts, global change, ozone depletion,
long-range prediction, ENSO phenomena, solar-weather relationships,
land surface changes, paleoclimate studies, and ecosystem dynamics.
</p>




<b>V.</b> <b><u>Component Models and Development Plans</u></b>

<p>
The component model plans appearing below describe the research and
development plans of a large number of individuals gathered into
several groups that roughly correspond to the subheadings under the
major components. Each group or individual has plans to build better
component models, and the priority given to various parts of the plans
will be guided by the needs of the CSM project and by the interests of
the individual scientists. These plans will certainly change as
experience is gained with the components in the CSM context. 
</p>

<p>
Chemistry appears in some form within each of the component models
rather than as a separate component because the important processes
and compounds are different within the atmosphere, ocean, and
land. For example, CO in the atmosphere is an inert, nearly well
mixed gas whose concentration is controlled by sources and sinks at
the surface, modified by atmospheric transport (Erickson et al.,
1994; Tans et al., 1990). However, CO emission and uptake by
the land and ocean biota are controlled by complex biogeochemical
processes that are crucial components of the climate system (Schimel
et al., 1990; Sarmiento et al., 1993).
</p>

<p>
The most mature component models are the atmospheric and oceanic GCMs
and, to a lesser extent, the land biophysical model. Therefore, their
plans describe specific, current research issues that are expected to
result in model improvements in the immediate future. The
chemical and biogeochemical models of the atmosphere, ocean, and land
are less mature than the physical models. In consequence, the plans
given below are more general for these models, although specific
projects are given for the short term.
</p>

<p><b>NCAR CSM:  Atmosphere Component</b></p>

<p><i>Overview</i></p>

<p>
Atmospheric modeling, with roots in early atmospheric climate
simulations begun in the mid 1950's, represents the most mature aspect
of climate system modeling. Indeed, much of what is currently
understood about the role of the atmosphere in the climate system has
been discovered through the judicious use of the experimental testbed
afforded by atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). Despite
this long  history, climate system modeling
presents a demanding scientific challenge to those modeling the
atmosphere.  The atmospheric model will be required to simulate
atmospheric behavior in a coupled interactive context, a more
demanding requisite than merely simulating the atmosphere with the
strong constraints of specified ocean surface temperatures and sea ice
distributions.  The atmospheric model will also be required to
accurately transport chemical constituents, and in some
configurations, drive an upper-atmospheric model with momentum, heat,
and constituent fluxes.
</p>

<p>
NCAR has a long history of developing and using AGCMs, starting with
the grid-point models of the late 1960's and early 1970's designed by
Kasahara and Washington and progressing to the spectral CCMs of the
present day.  The latest model in this series, the NCAR CCM2, forms
the basis for the atmosphere component of CSM. CCM2 is usually
configured as a tropospheric model with a top in the upper
stratosphere but can also be configured as a middle atmosphere model,
extending from the surface to the upper mesosphere. A land
biophysics model (Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS)) is
presently included in  CCM2, but will soon
become part of a separate land component model.
</p>

<p>
Radiative forcing is directly influenced by the abundance in the
atmosphere of trace gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, ozone and the chlorofluorocarbons.  Sulfate aerosols also
affect the radiative budget of the Earth/ atmosphere system.  Industrial, as
well as agricultural, activities have perturbed significantly the chemical
composition of the atmosphere at the regional and global scales, and hence
the climate forcing.  It, therefore, is  important that the interactions
between biogeochemical cycles and the physical climate system be accurately
represented in the CSM.  We will develop chemical modules
to be included in the atmospheric component of the CSM and to account for
the exchanges of chemical compounds with the continental biosphere and the
oceans. The chemical modules will be integrated into the
full CSM after careful testing and validation.  The emphasis will be on
the cycles of carbon and sulfur, and their impact on the climate system.
In addition, the role of other radiative gases such as ozone and methane,
which contribute to the ``greenhouse effect,'' will be investigated. 
</p>

<p>
We also present subsections on a nested regional modeling capability
that will be included in the CSM, and an upper-atmosphere model that
may eventually lead to a merging of CCM2 with upper-atmosphere
components to give a full atmosphere component for the CSM.
</p>

<p><b>Community Climate Model</b></p>

<p>
Over the last three years, the Climate Modeling Section integrated a large
number of simulation capabilities into a single cohesive modeling
framework, the CCM2. The most recent version (CCM2.1) includes
BATS for computing surface
exchanges over land.  The individual and collective behavior
of various model components were validated against available observational
data.  These components were modified accordingly, followed by major
refinements to the overall implementation for optimal computational
performance.
</p>

<p>
The result of this effort, the NCAR CCM2, is a new AGCM for which most
aspects of the formulation represent improvements over the CCM1.  The
principal algorithmic approaches carried forward from CCM1 are the use
of a semi-implicit, leap-frog time integration scheme, the use of the
spectral transform method for treating dry dynamics, the use of a
bi-harmonic horizontal diffusion operator, and the large-scale
condensation process. The CCM2 makes use of new algorithms for both
resolved dynamics and parameterized physics, which are documented in
Hack et al. (1993).  The standard model configuration uses a
horizontal spectral resolution of T42 (
transform grid), 18 vertical levels, and a top at 2.917 mb.  It
employs a 20 minute time step by dynamically adjusting the spectral
resolution of the top layer to maintain a Courant number of less than
one. A middle-atmosphere version of CCM2 is also maintained. This
version uses 44 levels between the surface and 0.017 mb (
km).
</p>

<p>
Two major improvements are included in the CCM2 dynamical formalism.
The first is the incorporation of a hybrid vertical coordinate that
follows terrain near the surface (traditional sigma) and transitions
to a pure pressure coordinate above about 100 mb.  A second major
change to the resolved dynamics is the incorporation of a
shape-preserving semi-Lagrangian transport (SLT) scheme (Williamson
and Rasch, 1994) for advecting water vapor.  This scheme can also be
used to transport an arbitrary number of other scalar fields (e.g.,
cloud water variables, chemical constituents, etc.) as required by a
CSM.  The use of the SLT method largely addresses the many numerical
problems exhibited by the spectral advection approach used in earlier
versions of the CCM.
</p>

<p>
Aspects of the CCM2 dynamic, thermodynamic, and radiative climate
statistics are documented in Hack et al. (1994) and Kiehl 
et al. (1994). The physical representation of a wide range of key
climate processes in CCM2 is much more physically realistic than in
previous versions of the CCM. Hurrell et al. (1993) present a
comparison of the climatology of CCM2 with CCM1, GENESIS, and the
atmospheric component of the coupled ocean-atmosphere model of Washington
and Meehl (1993).  Overall, the model climatology is substantially
better than climates produced by previous versions of the model, which
generally suffered from a variety of large biases in the mean climate
state.  The most serious of these earlier biases, a systematically
cold and dry model troposphere, has to a large extent been
eliminated. Although the simulated climate continues to be cold, it is
now generally within  to  K of what is analyzed,
exhibiting excellent agreement with analyses and observations in the
tropics.  The simulated three-dimensional water vapor distribution is
also in very good agreement with both analyses and selected
observational station data. The most serious coupled
problems in CCM2 are likely to be its excessive latent heat fluxes,
precipitation, and surface stresses in the tropics.
</p>

<p><b>Actions during Start-up Phase</b></p>

<p>
During the CSM start-up phase, the developers of CCM2 and other
atmospheric modelers will work together with the ocean modelers to
carry out and analyze simulations with the coupled
land-atmosphere-ocean model.  The atmospheric scientists will work on
problems that arise during coupled calculations in a collaborative
mode with other members of the CSMIG. Many improvements will be
included in the model, based on the long-term research projects listed
below.
</p>

<p>
The standard T42, 18-level CCM2 with BATS has been restructured to
interface with the flux coupler and will provide the land and
atmosphere components for the initial development of the CSM. An
independent land surface model, with its own history carrying and
restart capabilities, is being developed based on existing land
components of the CCM2 code.  The independent land model will couple
to CCM2 through the flux coupler to facilitate introduction of
alternative land surface models.
</p>

<p><b>Long-Term Research</b></p>


<p>
NCAR and other scientists will continue to concentrate on improving
atmosphere components of the CSM.  In the following we list areas of
immediate concern and scientists who are committed to work on them.
Although this section is referred to as long-term research, most
efforts are currently underway.  When improvements are documented and
acceptable to the CSMIG, they will be incorporated in the CSM.
</p>

<p>
Large warm bias in simulated land surface temperature over the
Northern Hemisphere during July.  Other aspects of surface climate,
such as precipitation and surface energy exchanges, are strongly
affected by this bias.  The principal source of this problem is the
diagnosis of cloud optical properties. Techniques that more
realistically diagnose cloud droplet effective radius as a function of
space and time and cloud liquid water path as a function of the space-
and time-dependent atmospheric state have been independently explored
by Kiehl (1994) and Hack (1994).  The combination of these two
approaches substantially reduces many
temperature and precipitation biases observed in CCM2 Northern
Hemisphere summer circulation.  (Kiehl, Hack)
</p>

<p>
Anomalous positioning of deep convection in the Western Pacific.
This anomalous position affects wave propagation and long-wave
positioning in January simulations, contributing to excessive ridging
over the North Pacific and a reduction in the height field over
Western North America. The incorporation of improved cloud optical
properties results in a northward displacement of the diabatic
heating, a correspondingly improved Australian monsoon, and more
realistic ridging throughout the troposphere along western North
America.  The magnitude of the precipitation maxima remains
unreasonably large, and its position remains too far west, apparently
associated with excessive boundary layer transport of water vapor in
deep convective regimes.  (Hack, Tribbia)
</p>

<p>
Wind stress over the tropical Pacific remains too strong compared to
estimates from atmospheric analyses.  In this region 
model stresses actually converge with increasing resolution but to
values different from the atmospheric estimates (Williamson et
al., 1994).  These model stresses are expected to have serious
consequences when coupled to an ocean model.  Research will be
directed toward identifying and removing this deficiency.  (Tribbia,
Gent, Boville)
</p>

<p>
Simulated polar tropopause temperatures are significantly
colder than observed, particularly in summer. This problem is common
to almost all AGCMs and its source is currently being investigated.
Possible deficiencies in both the thermodynamic (cloud/ radiation) and
dynamic (gravity wave) parameterizations are being examined.
(Boville, Saravanan)
</p>

<p>
Orographic locking of precipitation.  Spurious precipitation over
high terrain can have a serious impact on land surface models. Two
possible causes of the spurious precipitation are being investigated,
elevated heat sources and numerical errors associated with terrain
following vertical coordinates. (Williamson)
</p>

<p>
Numerical methods for transport of chemical constituents.  The
semi-Lagrangian method of CCM2 is a good starting point but not ideal.  It
addresses the most serious problems associated with the spectral transform
method.  Most chemistry researchers would be more comfortable with schemes
that locally enforce conservation.  Research will be direct toward adapting
such schemes for global applications. (Rasch, Williamson)
</p>

<p>
The need to pre-specify the order of parameterizations within a time
step. Physical parameterizations in CCM2 are approximated in a time split
manner to allow efficient solutions of the implicit components
incorporated in them.  Since these parameterizations depend on each other, at
least one of the connections is lagged one time step.  The current ordering,
arrived at through evolution of the CCM series, may not be appropriate for the
coupled system.  We will consider alternative orderings in atmospheric and
coupled simulations. (Williamson)
</p>

<p>
The Antarctic winter vortex in the stratosphere is
much too strong and the polar temperatures are too cold by up to 40 K
in the middle atmosphere version of CCM2. This deficiency has been
traced to inadequate mesospheric gravity wave drag by Garcia and
Boville (1994). The middle atmosphere version of CCM2 currently uses
Rayleigh friction to parameterize the effects of breaking gravity
waves in the mesosphere. A single vertical profile of coefficients is
employed that is horizontally uniform. This scheme does not provide a
reasonable, physically-based context for improvements. More
physically-based parameterizations are being considered and will be
included in future versions of the model. (Boville)
</p>

 
<p><b>Atmospheric Chemical Transport Models</b></p>


<p>
ACD, jointly with CGD, has developed a
hierarchy of three-dimensional chemical transport models (CTMs) that
will contribute to development of an integrated CSM.  One of them
(Rasch et al., 1993) is run ``on-line'' with the middle atmosphere
version of CCM2 to simulate the three-dimensional distribution of
approximately 25 species that govern production and destruction rates
of ozone in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere.  The calculated
distribution of radiatively-active gases such as ozone and water vapor
can be used to calculate radiative heating rates so that coupling
between stratospheric chemistry and dynamics is adequately
represented. A tropospheric version of the CTM will be run with an
appropriate chemical scheme and detailed surface emission rates and
deposition velocities both within CCM2 and ``off-line'', driven by dynamical variables
provided by CCM2.  An ``off-line'' stratospheric version of the CTM is
also available.  Finally, preliminary global model studies have been
performed by prototype models, such as the three-dimensional 
Intermediate Model for Annual and Global Evolution of Species (IMAGES).
</p>

<p><b>Start-up phase</b></p>


<p>
During the start-up phase of CSM, we will focus on validation of the
above models based on available observations.  At the same time, to
address the needs of CSM, simplified approaches to represent chemical
processes and their roles in the climate system will be developed.
Preliminary coupling studies will also be conducted.
</p>

<p>
Model validation will be performed by comparing calculated distributions of
chemical constituents with observed fields.  Comparison is relatively
straightforward for several stratospheric species for which satellite
data are often available (LIMS, TOMS, UARS, etc.).  It is more
difficult for reactive species in the troposphere that have only
episodic measurements from the ground, balloons, and aircraft.
</p>

<p><b>Carbon Cycle Modeling</b></p>

<p>
CO plays a central role in all proposed scenarios related to the
climate of the 21st century.  The mixing ratio of CO in the
atmosphere is largely controlled by exchanges with the ocean and the
terrestrial biosphere. To study the complex cycles that
influence carbon on the planetary scale and to address the relative
contribution of various surface CO emission scenarios in Earth's
climate, several atmospheric CO tracers can be included in
the CCM2 (Erickson et al., 1994).  Each tracer is related to
different surface source and sink representations in the model, such as
air-sea exchange, fossil fuel combustion, biomass
burning/deforestation, and exchange with the terrestrial biosphere.
</p>

<p>
The air-sea exchange of CO is directly controlled by the
distribution of CO in the surface ocean.  An observational data
base for surface ocean CO is being compiled by several researchers
around the world.  The exchange of CO between the terrestrial
biosphere and the atmosphere is a complex process that involves a
variety of biological and geophysical variables. 
A satellite-based estimate of the magnitude and phasing of the
CO uptake and release by the terrestrial biosphere is being used presently.
An interactive biosphere is being developed whereby the CO
exchange process is influenced at each time step by the dynamical
variables in the atmospheric models. All model runs are compared to a
comprehensive observational data base on atmospheric CO, at 35
sites worldwide, supplied via collaboration with the NOAA-CMDL group.
A smaller observational data base dealing with the isotopic
composition of atmospheric CO will also be used to constrain the
global carbon cycle in an independent fashion.  
</p>

<p>
The CSM effort will
support the further developments of the global three-dimensional
carbon modeling effort in conjunction with development of the
aforementioned chemistry transport models.  The global
three-dimensional GCM modeling activity will be complemented by
several other sub-models of varying spatial and temporal resolution.
These models include soil carbon dynamics models, terrestrial
biosphere CO exchange models, and surface ocean biogeochemical
models, which are discussed in other sections of this document.
</p>


<p><b>Sulfur Cycle, Aerosols, and Atmospheric Radiation Modeling</b></p>

<p>
Several observational and theoretical studies have suggested that
atmospheric aerosols influence the scattering and absorption of
radiation in the atmosphere with a direct effect on surface
temperatures.  Atmospheric sulfur, in the form
of sulfate aerosols, is thus an important component of the CSM.
Preliminary modeling efforts have already computed the global
distribution of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and the possible
influence on Earth's climate using CCM2 and other AGCMs.  A
sulphate aerosol model will be developed and coupled to the radiation
calculation in the atmospheric model to assess their possible climatic
influence.
</p>

<p>
Other aerosols, such as carbonaceous aerosols that are related to
biomass burning and other combustion processes and mineral dust
aerosols originating in desert regions, may also influence the
radiative properties of the atmosphere.  We will attempt to model the
distributions of these aerosols based on estimates of their surface
sources and incorporate their radiative effects in the
atmospheric model.
</p>

<p><b>Tropospheric Ozone Modeling</b></p>


<p>
Tropospheric ozone is important as a greenhouse gas and as an oxidant, 
and its abundance has increased dramatically over the last century.
The abundance of tropospheric ozone is determined by a number of
complex chemical processes involving anthropogenic and biogenic
precursors.  Although much attention has been given to the mechanisms
affecting ozone in the boundary layer, the chemical budget of ozone in
the upper troposphere, where its effect on the radiative forcing is
largest, remains poorly quantified (Hauglustaine et al., 1994).
</p>

<p>
A chemical transport model of the troposphere will be developed
that simulates the processes that lead to chemical production and
destruction of ozone and other oxidants and takes into account the
surface emission and deposition of the chemical constituents, as well
as their three-dimensional advective and convective transport.  This
model is also intended to derive the spatial and global distribution
of the hydroxyl radical, which determines the global lifetime of many
chemical species including methane and contributes to the conversion
of reduced sulfur species into sulfuric acid (and hence sulfate
aerosols).  The chemical scheme used in this particular model will be
based on the classic Ox, NOx, CH, CO scheme with a simplified
formulation of the effect of non-methane hydrocarbons.
</p>

<p>
The prototype model for this project is IMAGES,
which includes a rather
detailed chemical scheme, but is limited by its simplified transport
formulation.  The model is also constrained by observational data,
limiting its ability to treat interactions with the physical climate
system.  A more advanced framework will be provided by an ``off-line''
version of CCM2.  In this case, the transport will be driven by the
dynamical variables (winds, temperature, convection, clouds,
precipitation, etc.) provided at selected time intervals.  The CTM
will be coupled to the land surface model of CSM, which will provide
ecosystem distributions, as well as biogenic fluxes of several chemical
compounds.  The precipitation of other gases including nitrates
provided by the CTM will be used by the land surface model as input
for its vegetation scheme.  Finally, an ``on-line'' version of the CTM
will be developed.  This will probably require that the chemical
scheme be simplified to reduce the computational
burden.  Rather than calculating explicitly the concentration of all
chemical species, a possible approach is to derive at each location of
the atmosphere variations in the concentrations from given
climatological values, making use of appropriate assumptions and
simplifications.
</p>

<p><b>Stratospheric Ozone Modeling</b></p>


<p>
Ozone depletion in the stratosphere is one of the most dramatic changes
observed in the Earth system.  It is expected to affect the thermal
structure and possibly the circulation of the atmosphere, as well as
the level of biologically damaging UV-B radiation at the surface.  We
expect to further develop the stratospheric version of the CTM.  The
model will account for the effects of industrially manufactured
chlorofluorocarbons and include explicitly the impact on the ozone
layer of compounds belonging to the oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,
chlorine, and bromine families.  Special attention will be given to
the importance of heterogeneous processes occurring on the surface of
solid particles inside polar stratospheric clouds and of liquid/solid
sulfate aerosol particles at all latitudes.  The radiatively active
species derived by the CTM (such as ozone and water vapor) will be
coupled to the GCM and hence affect directly the calculated 
temperature and circulation in the stratosphere.
</p>

<p><b>Regional Atmospheric Model</b></p>

<p>
In the last several years, a one-way nested regional climate modeling
capability has been developed at NCAR in which a limited area model
is driven either by analyses of observations or by GCM output (Giorgi,
1990; Giorgi et al., 1993; Giorgi et al., 1994). This
nested modeling technique allows us to produce long-term regional climate
simulations at resolutions of a few to several tens of km.  This
capability can be useful to CSM in at least three respects: 1) in
developing and testing the performance of physical parameterizations
at high resolution; 2) in carrying out pilot coupling studies, whereby
regional ocean, sea ice, hydrology, and ecosystem models can be
interactively coupled with the regional atmospheric model over
selected areas of interest; and 3) in bridging the scale gap between
climate models and impact models, since climate scenarios at a few
tens of km resolution, or less, can be produced.
</p>

<p><b>Start-up phase</b></p>

<p>
Recently, a second generation version of the NCAR regional climate
model (RegCM2) has been completed. This version of the model includes
BATS, the CCM2 planetary boundary layer and radiative transfer
calculations, and three cumulus parameterization options (including
that of the CCM2). In the start-up phase we plan to 1) complete a
10-year run with RegCM2 driven by the European Center for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses of observations over
a domain encompassing the whole continental U.S. at 50 km
resolution. This run will allow careful validation of the model
climatology over the U.S. and identify and correct main model
biases; and 2) produce multi-year runs of present day climate
conditions with RegCM2 (50 km resolution) driven by CCM2 output over
the U.S. and Europe.  These runs will serve as validation of the
coupled RegCM/CCM modeling system.
</p>

<p><b>Long-term research</b></p>

<p>
In the long term we plan to: 1) produce and make available to the
community increasingly accurate and computationally efficient versions
of the RegCM suitable for regional climate simulations at resolutions
of up to 10--30 km. This will likely require development of
parameterizations, e.g., for precipitation and surface processes,
suitable for such resolutions; 2) carry out pilot studies with the
RegCM coupled with regional ocean, sea ice, hydrology, and biosphere
models. Examples of regions of interest for such coupling studies are
the continental U.S. (in particular the Great Lakes basin), the
northern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea Basins, and eastern
Asia; 3) produce high-resolution regional climate change scenarios
with the RegCM driven by climate change simulations performed with the
CSM. It is anticipated that, depending on computing resources, among
the regions for which such scenarios may be generated will be the
continental U.S., Europe, eastern Asia, and the Sahelian region.
</p>

<p><b>Upper Atmosphere Model</b></p>

<p>
The middle and upper atmosphere must be considered to obtain accurate
models for long-term climate studies.  The middle and upper atmosphere
are coupled both physically and chemically to the lower atmosphere 
with mutual interactions important for understanding both interannual
variability and long-term climate change.  Dynamical interactions
between planetary waves, gravity waves, and the mean circulation
introduce considerable variability to the basic structure and dynamics
of the middle and upper atmosphere that is not well understood.  It
seems certain that the dynamical state of the middle atmosphere (at
least through the middle stratosphere) has a significant impact on the
circulation of the troposphere through mechanisms that are also not
well understood.  Transport of chemically and radiatively active gases
from the troposphere can significantly alter chemical and radiative
balances of the middle and upper atmosphere, leading to changes in its
basic structure and seasonal evolution.  Effects of solar variability
occur on time scales ranging from that of the Maunder Minimum through
the 80-year Gleisberg cycle, the 11-year sunspot cycle, the 27-day
solar rotation cycle, to shorter term solar flare, solar proton event,
and geomagnetic storm variations.  Finally, electrodynamic couplings
between the upper atmosphere wind dynamo, solar wind/magnetosphere
dynamo, and thunderstorms in the global electric circuit could have
important long-term variations that influence the climate system
(e.g., more lightning activity with global change).
</p>


<p><b>Start-up phase</b></p>

<p>
The CSM flux coupler will be used to couple the NCAR
Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General
Circulation Model (TIME-GCM) to CCM2. The TIME-GCM solves for the
circulation, temperature, compositional, and electrodynamic structure
of the atmosphere between 30 (10mb) and 500 km.  The flux coupler will
be applied at the 10 mb constant pressure surface and initially will
be a one-way coupling, using fluxes of heat, momentum, and composition
from the lower atmosphere as inputs to the TIME-GCM to evaluate their
impact on the dynamics and structure of the upper atmosphere.  Once
upward coupling is examined, mutual interactions between the two
models may be attempted.
</p>

<p>
This coupling represents the most expedient way of evaluating the
importance of upper atmosphere structure and dynamics on CSM.
Eventually, some subset of TIME-GCM physics and chemistry will be
extracted and incorporated into a CSM atmosphere model that extends
from ground to thermosphere, and includes couplings with the solar
wind through auroral processes to achieve a consistent model structure
instead of two dissimilar models coupled at the 10 mb surface.
Nevertheless, much science and information can be obtained with the
initial effort.
</p>

<p><b>Long-term research</b></p>

<p>Problems involved in modeling the middle and upper atmosphere include: <br>

Non-LTE radiation. Radiative cooling from CO and O is
non-LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) above about 60 km,
introducing complexity into calculation of cooling rates in the upper
atmosphere.  Furthermore, collisions with O strongly enhance CO
radiation near 100 km, albeit with poorly-known rate coefficients, an
interaction important for determining the structure of the mesopause
region.
</p>

<p>
Chemical effects of particle fluxes.  Reactive chemical species
(e.g., NO and HO) are produced when energetic electrons and
protons bombard the upper and middle atmosphere during geomagnetic
storms, solar flares, and auroral sub-storms.  The particle fluxes are
highly variable both spatially and temporally, and during strong solar
proton events, can produce as much NO in the middle atmosphere as
a full year photodissociation of NO. We need to understand this
variability for possible natural influences on global change.

</p>




<p><b>NCAR CSM: Ocean Component</b></p>

<p><b>Background</b></p>

<p>
Modeling of large-scale ocean circulation has a long history at NCAR.
Model development and application has been a central theme of research in 
CGD's Oceanography Section for 20 years. Early work focussed upon process 
studies in limited areas to examine fundamental oceanic 
processes at work in isolation. At the same time,
eddy-resolving oceanic GCMs were developed
to examine the role played by mesoscale eddy processes in
large-scale gyre dynamics. This array of work evolved in the mid-1980s 
into the WOCE-driven CME that was begun at NCAR to examine, for a
single ocean basin (the North Atlantic), the oceanic general circulation
at a variety of resolutions (, and ) 
in anticipation of
eventually moving to the global domain (Bryan and Holland, 1989; 
Boning et al.,
1994; Holland and Bryan, 1993a,b). This work has involved an assessment
of the wind and thermohaline--driven circulation and particularly its
climate characteristics (heat transports, temperature/salinity property distributions,
overturning mass transports, etc.) with the view of building a better
large-scale ocean circulation model. 
</p>

<p>
Models of the global ocean based upon the GFDL model have also been 
implemented at NCAR and a variety 
of calculations
carried out. A series of equilibrium calculations, each run for approximately
10000 years, has been carried out with a low-resolution 
( latitude/longitude) version  of the Modular Ocean
Model (MOM), 
making use of many of the improvements
in physical parameterization discussed below (Danabasoglu et al., 1994).
Other global calculations have been carried out for shorter times at higher resolutions
(Semtner and Chervin, 1992) with the original GFDL 
physics as a demonstration of the capability to carry out global, eddy--resolving
calculations. These, together with the North Atlantic
experiments mentioned above and the ENSO modeling discussed below, will form the physical basis for our future CSM
ocean component model.
</p>

<p>
Coupled calculations are already underway using a variety of ocean model
components. For example, Gent and collaborators have been exploring climate 
variability connected with ENSO. It is one of the strongest coupled modes, and, by a
widely accepted hypothesis, may only involve the ocean importantly in the
upper tropical Pacific. ENSO phenomena have been studied at NCAR both in 
a stand alone model of the upper,
tropical Pacific Ocean (Gent and Cane, 1989;
Gent, 1991) and in coupled mode with the global CCM2 atmospheric model (Gent 
and Tribbia, 1993). For the present, the tropical Pacific model will 
continue to be used for coupled experiments of ENSO behavior
until the CSM model provides a satisfactory alternative.
Similarly, low-resolution coupled experiments (e.g., Washington and Meehl, 1989)
addressing IPCC issues are in progress, giving us additional experience
with the oceanic role in addressing coupling questions.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there have been important developments in the 
implementation of alternative software architectures for running the
GFDL model efficiently on other computer systems in a massively parallel
fashion (Smith et al., 1992). The intention of the 
ocean team effort in CSM is to
combine the best choices for ocean physics (i.e., parameterizations of mixing
in the ocean interior; a better mixed layer parameterization; more suitable
numerical algorithms for advection; etc.) with a computational
structure for the ocean model component that best fits the NCAR computing
environment. A new level of sophisticated physical parameterizations is
in hand; now we must move toward implementing this in an
optimal computing environment.
</p>


<p><b>Strategy</b></p>

<p>
We are currently in a period of very active development of the traditional 
GFDL model in the areas of parameterized physics (isopycnal mixing,
surface boundary layer), numerical formulation (coordinate systems,
discretization, transport schemes), and software architecture (modularity,
parallel implementation). We can expect rapid evolution of the 
``standard" CSM ocean component with a range of alternative
configurations to be available in the next year.
</p>

<p>
While some options with potentially improved solutions will be available in
the short term, we will begin by providing a suite of global modules based on 
GFDL MOM Code 1.1, with varying resolution  and our current ``best choice" set of
reasonably well-tested physical parameterizations.
The ocean team will be responsible for assembling and regularly improving
this global ocean GCM for use in a wide variety of climate
problems.  In particular, this model will be judged by its performance 
both in an uncoupled mode with specified surface boundary conditions, as
well as when
coupled to other component models of the climate system.
While the scope of the ocean model includes physical transport processes,
biogeochemical processes, and sea ice, these will come along at different
rates and be included in different complexities as they are ready.
</p>

<p>
The general approach is to create some early versions of the model; establish
benchmark solutions in an uncoupled mode with surface boundary conditions from
either empirical data or atmospheric model output; use these solutions as
initial conditions for prototype coupled calculations focusing initially on
relatively short time scales (annual and interannual); and then establish a
long-term cycle of investigating possible model improvements, computing new
solutions in both uncoupled and coupled modes for different phenomenological
regimes, and comparing these solutions to observations.  The coupled
solutions, in particular, will be designed and analyzed in collaboration with
other participants in the CSM effort.  
</p>

<p><b>Physical Ocean Models</b></p>

<p>
The physical circulation and transport model includes all processes, either in
its resolved dynamics or through subgrid scale parameterizations, that are
necessary for geographically realistic calculations of the global ocean
circulation and its variability on all climatic time scales from the daily
cycle to paleoclimatic evolution. Virtually all aspects of the ocean
general circulation are potentially of interest, but the first focus will be
upon the thermohaline convective circulations, the wind-driven equatorial and
Antarctic zonal currents and extra-tropical gyres, the sea-surface temperature
and surface boundary layer profiles, and the water-mass distributions of
temperature and salinity.  The model's design
criteria include variable resolution, alternative domain specifications (so
that regional or upper-ocean configurations can be used where apt), and a code
architecture that supports many variants in its elements --- all within a common
model framework so that systematic solution intercomparisons can be made.
</p>

<p>
In future implementations, other alternative versions of the GFDL code
will be considered. This is important because the CSM in its whole must
be tailored architecturally to the NCAR computing environment. The ocean
code structure for the future will thus evolve, making use of the best choices
that derive from efforts at GFDL, DOE, and NCAR, which have alternative
structures for the basic GFDL code. Melding the numerics with the
improved physical parameterizations will give us a powerful new tool
for CSM and for ocean-only studies as well.
</p>

<p>
Issues to be addressed to improve ocean models in  coupled
and uncoupled mode can be divided into three categories: (a) improved
parameterization of physical processes in the model formulation, (b) improved
numerical algorithms and efficiency in the ocean model, and (c) improved
data sets used to force the ocean model in uncoupled runs and to critically
test its ability to reconstruct the temperature--salinity properties of
the global ocean.
The issues currently being explored in these categories and the scientists 
committed to working on them are:
</p>

<p><b>Physical Issues</b></p>


<p>
The effects of mesoscale eddies must be parameterized in ocean
models that do not resolve them. A recent proposal based upon isopycnal form drag
and tracer mixing (Gent and McWilliams, 1990; McWilliams and Gent, 1994;
Gent et al., 1994) has been implemented in a global 
model and has  shown (Danabasoglu et al., 1994) very promising 
improvements in the simulation of
several quantities important in climate models such as northward heat
transport. (Danabasoglu; Gent; McWilliams)
</p>

<p>
Interaction between the atmosphere and ocean occurs in boundary layers.
Having a realistic representation of this complex of processes is important
in an ocean model. A new parameterization (Large et al., 1994)
for vertical mixing that uses a K-profile form in
the planetary boundary  layer (PBL)  and a local diffusivity in the interior 
has been developed. 
(Large; Doney)
</p>

<p><b>Numerical Issues</b></p>

<p>
Different vertical coordinate systems have different effects
on the results and need exploration for the climate problem. 
A stretched-sigma alternative to 
the standard vertical height coordinate
has been formulated and is being tested, 
including the reformulation of a simplified equation of state that can be
evaluated at arbitrary height, that is formally more accurate and provides
a different numerical treatment of the topographic lower boundary
condition. (Danabasoglu; Gent)
</p>

<p>
An upper-ocean model configuration with a stretched-sigma coordinate and a
climatological lower boundary condition beneath the thermocline (taken from
data or from a full-depth solution) will permit better vertical resolution,
greater computational efficiency, shorter time to approach equilibrium, and
less climate drift for calculations of short-term climate variability (up to
decadal). (Large; Gent)
</p>

<p>
Modified grid structure and adequate filtering is needed in the 
Arctic basin 
to avoid issues concerning the polar singularity that occurs in a regular 
latitude-longitude grid. (Gent; Bryan)
</p>

<p>
Alternative algorithms for tracer advection 
(e.g., Smolarkiewicz, 1984)
may be needed at some resolutions to prevent
unphysical concentrations due to numerical errors. Various
choices are being examined. (Hecht; Bryan; Holland) 
</p>

<p>
Alternative formulations of the external-mode, reference-pressure, or
free-surface solution method for computational efficiency and accuracy (e.g.,
Pinardi et al., 1994) are under development. These will be implemented
as necessary. (Chervin; Holland)
</p>

<p><b>Data Issues</b></p>

<p>
Adequate surface boundary conditions for uncoupled experiments are needed.
Data sets need to be improved for the specification of mean annual cycle of 
surface buoyancy forcing (restoring to
climatological temperature and salinity or prescription of the actual fluxes of heat
and fresh water) and wind stress forcing fields for uncoupled
solutions. (Large; Holland)
</p>

<p>
Improved climatologies of temperature and salinity and other chemical properties of
the interior of the ocean are needed as models improve. Critical tests
of the success of uncoupled and coupled model experiments will depend upon
having a high-quality observed climatic state of the ocean. (Owens; Holland;
Chow)
</p>

<p>
These issues will be the primary foci during the next two years of
the CSM project. On a longer time scale, other
developments will be pursued, including a reconsideration of the underlying
grid structure and numerical algorithms in the model.

Also, different spatial resolutions to establish the
cost/benefit curve for global solutions will be explored.  The
coarsest grid planned to work with is  20 levels.  Refinements to
 45 levels and
 45 levels 
are being tested. Given computational costs to run the coupled system to
equilibrium and given the need to explore alternative model specifications,
reaching mesoscale-eddy resolution for climate studies in the
immediate future except on an exploratory and regional basis is not anticipated. In this latter
respect coupled models with very high resolution in the equatorial region
or in the North Atlantic region will allow exploration of 
interactions in the coupled system in a regime where the oceanic
and atmospheric components are each capable of generating substantial unforced
variability.
</p>

<p>
For coupled calculations, development options will be selected, guided
substantially by progress in testing them.  For a particular selection, 
a full-depth, near-equilibrium solution for specified surface
forcing will be obtained.  That solution will then serve as initial conditions (and lower
boundary conditions for an upper-ocean model configuration) for the coupled
calculation.  A variety of different forcing fields will be examined 
to minimize drifts in the coupled solution.
</p>

<p><b>Sea Ice Models</b></p>

<p>
The sea ice model has two primary components: local ice formation or 
melting due to
thermodynamic forcing from above and below 
and horizontal advection of sea ice.  The
first connects crucially to the oceanic PBL model and
with the flux coupler that handles atmospheric surface fluxes.  The latter
must include a dynamic model of the sea ice with a proper parameterization of
horizontal, internal ice stress.
</p>

<p>
The formation or melting of sea ice due to vertical heat fluxes has been
considered from the outset in the formulation of the K-profile planetary
boundary layer model (Large et al., 1994).  In addition to predicting the mass
of ice at a grid point, the model must also include the fraction of ice cover
(compactness), since the large difference in ice temperature at its upper
surface and the ocean surface temperature (near the freezing point when
ice is nearby) produces significantly different heat fluxes to the atmosphere,
so that the two situations must be considered separately.  The formulation
will follow the standard conservation statements for ice mass and compactness
(Hibler, 1979; Parkinson and Washington, 1979).  In contrast to earlier models
that included the interaction of sea ice with ocean mixed layers
(Lemke et al., 1990), the formation of ice  occurring within the upper
grid points of the ocean boundary layer model and the melting of ice due
to the difference between the atmospheric and oceanic heat fluxes will
be considered.
</p>

<p>
A model for the advection of sea ice involves solving horizontal momentum
equations for sea ice, which crucially depend on proper parameterization of
internal ice stress.  From previous modeling studies (e.g., Owens and Lemke,
1990), it appears that one may need to include a viscous-plastic rheology as
formulated by Hibler (1979). However, for some purposes
an alternative, simplified treatment of the sea ice
rheology, a version of the formulation by Flato and
Hibler (1990) that includes only shear stresses, may be useful. 
A version of this latter model has recently been
recoded at NCAR and has been adapted to communicate with the flux
coupler. In the near future, a form of the Hibler model with the complete
rheology will also be implemented to work through the flux coupler and the
user may use either version.
</p>

<p><b>Biogeochemical Ocean Models</b></p>

<p>
The long-term goal is to develop a global model of the major marine
biogeochemical cycles (e.g., carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen), including  a
reasonable level of biological detail in the upper ocean and coupled fluxes of
CO and other radiatively important gases with the atmosphere.  As preliminary
steps towards that goal, three intermediate problems have been identified for
the next one to two years: the inorganic CO solubility pump, the 
seasonal cycle of productivity and phytoplankton biomass, and the ocean
uptake and transport of inert and radioactive tracers.
</p>

<p>
The full-depth ocean model configuration will be used to examine the ocean
transport of inorganic CO forced by solubility effects in the abiotic 
ocean, focusing
on the large-scale patterns driven by the thermohaline circulation. The
model simulations of the inorganic CO distribution and the geographic
and temporal patterns of the air-sea CO flux will be compared with 
observations and previous
model work (Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann, 1987).  The sensitivity
of the CO solutions to the new vertical and isopycnal mixing 
parameterizations 
will be explored. Early coupled calculations involving an abiotic, inorganic 
CO model and an interactive terrestrial carbon storage model are also
envisioned (see Biogeochemical and Ecosystem Processes: NCAR CSM Land
Component).
</p>

<p>
A nitrogen-based marine ecosystem model, adapted from the Fasham model 
(Sarmiento et al., 1993), will be incorporated into a global, 
upper-ocean 
configuration of the CSM ocean component, including the new 
parameterization of the surface boundary layer (Large et al., 1994).
The bottom boundary conditions for the coupled ecosystem model will be
specified from full-depth physical solutions together with available
nutrient climatologies (Levitus et al., 1993). The behavior of the 
ecosystem model has been examined in detail in the vertical (Doney and
Najjar, 1993), and alternative parameterizations of key biological processes
(e.g., grazing, particle remineralization, micronutrient fertilization, and
trophic and size class structure) will be explored in both the one-dimensional
and global models. The coupled biological-physical model will be used to
study a variety of questions on the seasonal to interannual time scale:
the evolution of inorganic nutrients, phytoplankton, and zooplankton
biomass; the rates of new and primary production; and the biological role of
horizontal and vertical transport.
Emphasis will be placed on understanding the seasonal cycle of spring blooms
in the mid- and high latitudes and on the biological response
to large-scale interannual variability such as ENSO. Validation
of the marine ecosystem model will utilize data from individual time-series
sites, historical nutrient and chlorophyll data sets, and the satellite
ocean color data from the upcoming Sea-viewing Wide-field-of-view
Sensor (SeaWiFS) project.
</p>
 
<p>
Both of these biogeochemistry problems will be carried out in conjunction with
physical transport studies using transient and natural chemical tracers, such
as radiocarbon, tritium, and chlorofluorocarbons that are essentially
non-reactive or have well known radioactive decay rates (e.g.,
Toggweiler et al., 1989a,b).  For this problem the surface atmospheric fluxes will be
prescribed from observations.
</p>

<p>
In the second phase of the CSM project, the abiotic CO and upper-ocean
ecosystem models will be combined into a full-depth, biotic carbon model. The
transition from the nitrogen-based ecosystem model to a full representation of
the carbon system is relatively straightforward, involving the addition
of variable C/N ratios for biological pools, CO air-sea exchange, and the
calcium carbonate cycle.

<p><b>NCAR CSM: Land Component</b></p>

<p>
The land is an integral part of the Earth system, influencing climate through
a variety of processes.  Key processes include surface energy exchange, the
exchange of trace gases, and the generation and transport of runoff, which in 
turn affects ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycles via river input.
The degree of coupling between terrestrial and climate
processes varies, as does the time scale over which that coupling occurs.  For
example, the coupling between stomatal conductance, influencing water and CO
exchange, and boundary layer climates is so close that in effect plant canopy
biophysics must be considered integral for the atmosphere.  At the other
extreme, soil carbon, a significant component in the global carbon budget,
responds to climate and influences atmospheric CO, 
but only on time scales of
decades to millennia. Coupling on intermediate
time scales occurs from the emission of biogenic compounds (e.g., methane, 
non-methane hydrocarbons) that have a profound influence on the ``chemical 
climate'' of the troposphere.
</p>

<p><b>Land Model Components</b></p>

<p>
The objective of including a terrestrial component in the CSM is to be able 
to examine
coupling between the climate system and land processes on multiple time
scales.  To address such interactions, a land model needs a series of
biophysical and biogeochemical components.  The structure proposed 
separates these components into (a) biophysics and 
hydrology and (b) biogeochemistry and ecosystem processes.  We propose to
bring these components into the program in a phased fashion that reflects the
readiness of the components within the land program and the overall plan of
experiments within CSM.
</p>

<p><b>Biophysics and Hydrology</b></p>

<p>
The land surface influences atmospheric physical processes through 
radiative fluxes, turbulent transfer, and the
partitioning of energy between latent and sensible heat.  Key modeling
issues in coupling the land surface to the atmosphere include:
</p>

<p>
Subgrid scale heterogeneity. Most land surface models have
the same spatial resolution as the atmosphere, neglecting variation
in vegetation and soil at smaller spatial scales. Three approaches
have been adopted to account for this subgrid scale heterogeneity:
(a) a finer land surface grid than the atmosphere, e.g., a 2
by 2 land grid and 4.5 by 7.5 atmospheric
grid (Bonan et al., 1992; Pollard and Thompson, 1994);
(b) explicit representation of several surface types for each grid with
the necessary fractional areas to average surface fluxes to the grid
(Avissar, 1992; Koster and Suarez, 1992); and (c)
closed-form analytical expressions that integrate over 
distributions of important heterogeneity (Entekhabi and Eagleson, 1989;
Johnson et al., 1993).
</p>

<p>
Runoff. The current generation of land surface models
have focussed on the coupling between the land and the atmosphere.
Future models must examine the coupling between the land and oceans.
Ocean circulations are affected by the magnitude of runoff through its
impact on temperature and salinity distributions.  River runoff delivers a
significant amount of nutrients
and dissolved organic carbon to the coastal ocean, and thus
affects oceanic biogeochemical cycling. The riverine input of dissolved
organic carbon in particular may be a significant component of the 
global carbon cycle (Siegenthaler and Sarmiento, 1993).
Improved runoff prediction will require better
schemes for runoff generation, including subgrid scale heterogeneity
in vegetation and soil types. It will also require a runoff routing
model that considers lateral flow of
runoff between adjacent grid cells, which current
land surface models ignore. This affects not only the
timing and magnitude of runoff to oceans but also soil water
and latent heat exchange. Once the runoff reaches a channel some 
form of river routing must be used.
</p>

<p>
Lakes and other wetlands. Lakes are a substantial
area of the terrestrial surface but are neglected in current land
surface models.  However, in regions with large areas of standing water (e.g., 
high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere), this can have a
significant effect on surface fluxes.
The ability to include lakes and other wetlands in the land
surface model depends on the parameterization of subgrid scale
heterogeneity because even on a
0.5 by 0.5 grid most lakes are too small to be resolved.
In addition, lakes and wetlands are important agents of
biogeochemical cycling, serving as sources, sinks, and transformers of
biological materials.  Wetlands are significant sources of groundwater
recharge and act as natural buffers against floods. Consequently,
the representation of lakes and wetlands must be closely tied
with the subgrid scale parameterization, hydrology, and biogeochemistry.
</p>

<p>
Model complexity. The degree of complexity with which
surface energy exchange should be represented is poorly understood
and is the subject of a land surface model intercomparison
project (Pitman et al., 1991). 
This issue is important because
of model sensitivity to land surface characteristics
that are poorly known, e.g., soil water holding capacity, plant
physiology. The complexity of a land surface model also affects
the parameterization of subgrid scale heterogeneity and
the links to biogeochemistry and ecosystem processes.
In addition, there are considerable discrepancies in
how micrometeorologists parameterize surface exchange models
for comparison with tower measurements and the surface
exchange models used in global climate models.
The micrometeorological models are  much more detailed,
but this complexity
is prohibitive in terms of computer time. The large discrepancy
between models needs to be further investigated.
</p>

<p>
Plant physiology. Recent land surface model development
has recognized the close linkage of biophysical and plant physiological
processes and the benefits of coupling these into a 
comprehensive land surface model (Sellers et al., 1992).
For example, latent heat
exchange and CO exchange are linked through stomatal resistance.
This coupling of stomatal resistance and photosynthesis provides
for additional land-atmosphere feedbacks, e.g., diurnal variation
in atmospheric CO concentration in the boundary layer and
long-term changes in atmospheric CO concentration.
Adding vegetation CO fluxes also provides new means to test
land surface models.
</p>

<p>
Plant growth and community structure. 
The fluxes of energy, 
water vapor, and momentum from the atmosphere to the land depend in a critical 
way on the structure of the plant community. Properties such as albedo
and surface roughness that are required by biophysical models are closely
related to the state of the biota (e.g., plant biomass and height, leaf area 
index, root-stem allocation), which changes on annual time scales due to 
the seasonal growth and die back at temperate and high latitudes and on longer 
time scales from shifts in vegetation composition (e.g.,  broadleaf deciduous
tree to grassland). These interactions can be studied either in isolation
or in a coupled mode whereby the feedbacks between surface fluxes and
plant behavior are allowed to occur (see Biogeochemical and Ecosystem 
Processes).
</p>

<p>
The initial implementation of the physical component of the land
surface model will use an existing global land surface model
while leaving the above issues as research projects. Emphasis will
be on the physical land-atmosphere coupling at the seasonal time scale.
Improved parameterization of subgrid scale heterogeneity,
hydrology (lakes, wetlands, runoff generation), and
links to biogeochemistry and ecosystem processes will be
brought on-line in due time as appropriate. Subgrid scale
heterogeneity, lakes, and wetlands can be added quickly
(i.e., within the first year).
The linkage of photosynthesis with energy exchange also 
has sufficient development to be brought on-line within the
first year (Bonan, 1994).  Coupling to ecosystem processes, such as
growth, nutrient cycling, and vegetation dynamics, is possible 
but will require more time (see below). These additional
components must be brought on-line in a systems approach that
addresses the coupling, linkages, and common processes
and state variables rather
than treating biophysics, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and
ecosystem processes as independent components.
</p>

<p><b>Biogeochemical and Ecosystem Processes</b></p>

<p>
Ecosystem and biogeochemical processes influence land-atmosphere interactions,
generally on longer time scales than effects of surface biophysical processes. 
Key processes include storage of carbon in living and non-living components of
the terrestrial biosphere, influence of the nitrogen cycle on carbon fixation
(photosynthesis) and storage, and long-term effects of vegetation structural
change (e.g., forestgrasslands, coniferdeciduous) on biogeochemistry and on
biophysical exchanges through changes in physiology, rooting depth, height, and
albedo. 
</p>

<p>
For early (though not initial) experiments in CSM, a model of terrestrial
biospheric storage and exchange of carbon is the primary target.  Such a model
will simulate carbon fixation as a function of climatic variables (providing a
forcing from climate), atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and the
nitrogen cycle (providing internal, nonlinear dynamics).  
The model will simulate decomposition as a function
of soil physical properties, climate, the N cycle, and plant organic chemistry.
The model will simulate the gross effects of land management on carbon
storage, as this is a crucial driver for ``realistic'' simulations of the 
carbon cycle.  
</p>

<p>
This model will
be based on the Century model developed by Parton, Schimel, and coworkers at
Colorado State University, but with significant simplification of
carbon-nitrogen interactions (Parton et al., 1994; Schimel et al.,
1994).  The Century component plays two important roles
in the coupled model.  It provides nitrogen to the land surface
parameterization, which constrains canopy development and conductance. 
Second, it computes terrestrial carbon storage as a function of climate
forcing and CO, modified by internal C/N dynamics, and thus, modifies
atmospheric CO concentrations over time.
</p>

<p>
In coupling to the physical land surface model, carbon fixation
will be derived from calculations of photosynthesis carried out in the
land surface parameterization to provide consistency between the carbon and
water cycle calculations. Soil temperature and water, needed
to simulate microbial activity,  will also be derived from the land 
surface parameterization. However, the biogeochemical model can simulate
carbon fixation and soil water itself at longer
temporal resolutions, so that the model can also be run uncoupled
from the short-term (i.e., less than 30 minute time step) biophysical model for
long calculations (e.g., 100s of years).
</p>

<p>
Three-dimensional calculations of CO effects on climate generally prescribe a
rate of CO increase based on extrapolation of historical trends.  In fact,
non-linear processes control the relationship between CO forcing and
atmospheric CO concentrations: a) the non-linear chemistry of CO oceanic
uptake; b) the highly non-linear effects of CO in biological uptake and
storage of C in the terrestrial biosphere; c) the potential effects of altered
ocean surface and thermohaline circulations on CO; and d) the effects of
physical climate changes (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) on the
biosphere.   Simple models suggest that growth rate and lifetime of CO are
sensitive to the inclusion of a  function that increases terrestrial uptake
as atmospheric CO increases.  These effects presumably affect the rate of
change of climate for any rate of change of anthropogenic CO, possibly with
significant interactions.  In more realistic ecosystem models, the ``''
function relates to the N cycle and to soil moisture, so direct CO effects
need to be simulated with a full ecosystem model.  A proposed first experiment
with a coupled climate system model including the terrestrial biogeochemical
component would be to simulate the evolution of climate, atmospheric CO, and
terrestrial C storage during a 100-year transient calculation with CO forcing
according to a prescribed scenario.  This calculation would require at a
minimum a geochemical CO uptake mechanism in the ocean model but could be
done with an upper ocean model.  Inclusion of a full-depth ocean model would
add additional possibilities to behavior of the physical climate system (e.g.,
Manabe and Stouffer, 1993) but would not be required for the initial carbon 
cycle calculation.  The terrestrial model required for this calculation could 
be ready in approximately one year with additional programming support.
</p>

<p>
Two other areas of ecosystem interactions are of interest: exchange of trace
gases other than carbon dioxide and effects of changing vegetation types on
biogeochemistry (CO and other species) and biophysics.  For trace gas
exchanges, no comprehensive model exists but a number of components exist,
including models for NO, non-methane hydrocarbons (Guenther 
et al., 1994), 
and methane (Holland et al., 1993).  Modeling of trace gases can be thought of
in two categories.  First are species such as NO (and CO), greenhouse gases,
but unreactive with weak influence in tropospheric reactions.  These gases may
be modeled like CO with no atmospheric reactions simulated.  Inclusion of
such gases allows the exploration of their effects on climate.  In a second
category are reactive chemical species, such as the NMHCs, methane, and NO. 
The emissions and uptake of these species is sensitive to climate and land
surface conditions, may influence climate through the lifetimes of greenhouse
species, and have profound effects on the OH-O chemistry of the troposphere. 
Coupling of simulations of the exchange fluxes of reactive species can only be
of interest when the terrestrial model is coupled to an atmospheric model
containing chemistry.  Since the simulations of chemistry require the fluxes
of a fairly large number of species, the ``jump'' from a CO model to a
CO-trace gas model is large.  Intermediate calculations may be possible, such
as calculations containing a methane source model and a simplified atmospheric
destruction model.  The timetable on coupled atmospheric-terrestrial
biogeochemistry models is somewhat indeterminate but will require two
to three years.
</p>

<p>
Tropical deforestation and ``boreal" deforestation experiments with
coupled land- atmosphere models raise the possibility
of coupled climate-vegetation dynamics in which the biogeographic
distribution of vegetation affects and is affected by climate
(Bonan et al., 1992; Henderson-Sellers, 1993).
In addition, recent steady state calculations of
terrestrial C storage under doubled CO climates with a biogeochemical model
(TEM: Melillo et al., 1993) showed that changing vegetation distributions
significantly affect C storage beyond the direct effects of climate on
biogeochemical processes. 
A number of equilibrium global vegetation models exist,
including a model developed as part of the GENESIS project at NCAR, a model
developed by the Henderson-Sellers group, the MAPSS model of Neilson, the DOLY
model of Woodward.  Considerable effort is underway to make these 
equilibrium models time-dependent, e.g.,
linking N and water availability to
changes in leaf area, and changes in leaf area to changes in growth form.  A
dynamic vegetation distribution model,
which links with the short-term biophysics and biogeochemistry,
should eventually be a component of the land team activity.
CSM scientists are currently involved in an EPRE-NASA-USFS-CSMP
supported intercomparison of vegetation models (Vegetation/Ecosystem
Modeling and Analysis Project VEMAP) which should provide insight into
the behavior of these models. Because the time table for developing
credible time-dependent vegetation type models is unclear, no timetable for
this activity can be given.  
</p>

<p><b>Validation</b></p>


<p>
Validation of land surface models will utilize global and in
situ data sets.  A number of important data sets exist. The new Advanced Very High
Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder activity
produces a satellite product for the land fundamentally superior to the GAC
and GVI products previously used, and improved algorithms for the extraction
of leaf area, interception of photosynthetically active radiation, and net
primary productivity now exist. Records of seasonal and interannual
variability of CO, C of CO, O, and oxygen isotopes provide
fundamental constraints on simulations of terrestrial carbon and water
cycling.  A significant number of globally-distributed, but point or regional
measures, also exist.  These include results of field campaigns in France, West
Africa, the central U.S., Northern Canada, Scandinavia, and Brazil, in which
comprehensive measurements exist.  Also available are several new compendia of
plant biomass and soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics from the U.S. Long Term
Ecological Research network, assembled globally by a SCOPE project and
recently published.  Finally, data on river runoff in major river basins and
dissolved and particulate carbon loading were recently published and made
available for testing runoff components of surface hydrology.  Critical gaps
in land surface data sets are soil moisture, important in biophysical and
biogeochemical calculations, for which no satisfactory remote techniques
exist, and snow cover,  for which satellite products have low spatial
resolution and poor estimation of depth and water content.

<p><b>NCAR CSM: Flux Coupler</b></p>

<p>Description</p>

<p>
The flux coupler (FC) provides the framework  of the CSM by providing
overall computing
control and interfacial physical coupling among the component system
models.  Control involves software engineering issues, such as 
model synchronization
and data communication between components. The coupling function addresses
issues such as the computation of physical quantities exchanged among CSM
components, as well as numerical questions such as those associated with 
interpolation between disparate grids of the component models. 
</p>

<p>
The control and coupling functionality are designed to allow each component to run with its own time
stepping scheme and to have its own grid structure.  The FC will make as few
demands upon component models as possible, and conversely, the models will
make minimal demands upon the coupler.  The FC and model components will
exchange minimal amounts of information with each bit of information
preferably transmitted only once.  Thus, each component model must maintain
some control structure. If, for example, a model requires lagged time
information, that component must store data received from the FC and use it
appropriately.  The FC, for its part, will only require that each component
model accept fluxes and flux-related quantities, such as albedo, as boundary
conditions.
</p>

<p>
The FC diverges from the most common practice of atmosphere-ocean model
coupling in two important ways. First, coupled models have
traditionally been implemented as single monolithic programs by
``subroutinizing" the component models. In the FC framework, each
component model remains as a stand-alone program. Second, interaction
between the atmosphere and the surface has generally been handled
completely within the atmospheric component model.  This severely
limits the flexibility of the system and makes it difficult to
accommodate component models with disparate spatial resolutions. In the
FC quantities computed on the surfaces between models are treated
independently of the models themselves. This set of choices is based on recent
experience at NCAR in modeling ocean-atmosphere interaction and draws
on recent developments at other institutions in the areas of ocean-atmosphere
and atmosphere-land surface coupling. Mechoso et al. (1993) and
Barth and Smith (1993), for example, have demonstrated the viability of
the message-passing approach. The approach adopted for computing
interfacial fluxes is very similar to that used to represent sub-grid scale
heterogeneity in land-surface process modeling (e.g., Koster and Suarez, 1992;
Avissar and Pielke, 1989). These issues are discussed
further below.  Two aspects of coupling not specifically being
addressed by the CSM FC project at the present time are (a)
asynchronous integration strategies (Dickinson, 1981) and (b) flux
adjustment  procedures (Sausen et al., 1988).
</p>

<p><b>Software Architecture and Computing Environments</b></p>

<p>
Given current computing trends, the FC is designed with the
capability to operate in a distributed, heterogeneous processor 
environment,  
as well as with a more traditional
single-system, shared-memory environment. We have constructed a system in which
the component models, as well as the FC itself, operate as a set of
separate, cooperating executables. Communication between the components
is facilitated through an explicit message-passing interface.
Each model sends just those data required by 
the FC, which then computes updated fluxes and returns them to the components,
allowing them to advance.
</p>

<p>
A message-passing FC allows orderly program development.  Models should require
far less modification to operate within the message-passing system than if it
were demanded that each model be ``subroutinized'' for coupling.  This greatly
increases the flexibility of the CSM system, permitting different component
models to be easily substituted.
Existing components should still run in their usual stand-alone mode with only
the invocation of the message exchanges, and some coordination functions,
required for use in the coupled mode.
</p>

<p>
In developing the FC, attention will be given to software-engineering principles and adoption of 
programming standards similar to those already in use among atmospheric
modelers (Kalnay et al., 1989).  These standards require 
``plug compatibility'' for internal FC 
subroutines; this modular approach should facilitate modifications, such as 
alternative flux formulations, interpolation routines, or extensions to
accommodate additional processes, e.g., chemistry. 
</p>

<p><b>Coupling Principles</b></p>

<p>
CSM model components will couple primarily through fluxes across component
boundaries, which requires formulating each component with flux boundary
conditions.  For example, the atmosphere component need not know sea-surface
temperature (SST) but only fluxes that the FC computes using SST from the ocean
component.  Conservation of fluxes becomes the most important principle. 
Even though fluxes may be modified in some manner by the receiving
model due to such functions as smoothing or filtering, each CSM component 
must see the same globally-averaged flux as another at interfaces shared 
by those models.
</p>

<p>
Spatial Aspects of Interaction. 
Two component models interacting through one of the interfaces will
generally not have the same horizontal resolution or identical grid
layout. This necessitates spatial averaging or interpolation of
quantities to be communicated between the models.  In this system a
distinction is made between two types of fluxes passing across an
interface. The first type is a flux computed by a component model.
These generally involve computationally intensive calculations over
the three-dimensional domain of the component model.  Examples include
the precipitation rate or downward radiative fluxes computed by the
atmosphere or the potential freezing rate computed by the ocean. The
second type is a flux computed at the interface itself based on the
(two-dimensional) surface states of the component models.  Examples
include turbulent heat fluxes across the air-sea interface or the
stress between the ocean and sea ice.  The general philosophy followed
here is that to the extent possible, the second type of flux should be
computed on the finer of the two grids defining an interface. The
outputs (both state variables and output fluxes) of the model at the
coarser resolution are interpolated to the finer resolution grid.
Fluxes requiring state information from both systems are computed on
the finer grid by the coupler. These fluxes are then spatially
averaged back to the coarser model grid in a conservative manner. In
the case where a component model (say atmospheric) grid cell contains
more than one surface type (say land and ocean), the fluxes from each
interface are averaged together in an area weighted manner into an
aggregate flux. This particular scheme was selected to allow for
subgrid-scale heterogeneity of surface types, to be conservative,
and to take maximum advantage of any high-resolution information
available in the system.
</p>

<p>
Temporal Aspects of Interaction.
Just as the component models may operate with different spatial
discretizations, they will generally have different time steps or
require updated fluxes at different time intervals. We follow a
similar procedure as used for handling disparities in spatial
resolution in handling temporal interactions. Fluxes on an interface
are computed at the frequency required by the model with the faster
time scales and temporally averaged over an interval called the
synchronization period before being passed to the model with the
slower time scales. The state variables on the interface from the
``slow" model are held fixed during this interval, while the output
fluxes and state variables of the ``fast" model are updated an integer
number of times. At the end of the synchronization period, all component
models will have seen the same flux passing through the interface.
</p>

<p><b>Work Plan</b></p>

<p>
The FC will be developed in two phases. The first, already well along, involves
the implementation of a basic system for atmosphere--ocean--sea ice
interactions, with the land model kept initially within the present (CCM2)
atmospheric component.
Modifications to the component models to allow
communication of two-dimensional fields of state variables and fluxes
are underway. In addition, tuning/optimization of the communication structures
are being examined. Our goal is to begin coupled experiments
using the flux coupler immediately so as to both test the FC aspects of the coupling 
and to begin to carry out useful coupled experiments from the physical
point of view.
</p>

<p>
The second phase of FC development will involve extensions to include
a separate land model, to include chemical processes that require
FC passing of information between components, and to include the
thermosphere as a separate component. In the long term, the FC will
provide an effective framework to switch in and out various sub-components
of the complete climate system model according to the desires of the
investigator.

<p><b>NSF Supported Staff for CSM</b></p>

<br>
<br>



<p><b>Non-NSF Supported Staff Contributing to CSM</b></p>

<p>
Several scientists and programmers at NCAR are supported by non-NSF
funds to work on specific projects that are closely related to CSM and
contribute directly to its goals.  For the flux coupler these
include:
</p>
<br>
<br>







<p><b>VI.</B> <b><u>Resource Requirements for CSM</u></b>

<b><a name="Personnel">Personnel Requirements Summary</a></b>

<p>
NCAR scientists have a very strong
interest and commitment to the CSM. There is
however a need for a long term commitment of dedicated resources to
support the activities of the CSM project. This involves establishing a
core group of programmers for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>developing, maintaining, documenting and
<li>disseminating the CSM code;
<li>managing the computations and data
sets created and making them available to the outside user community;
<li>aiding in the development of new components or revisions of
existing components;
<li>providing general support to CSM activities, including developing
and maintaining analysis tools. 
</ul>

<p>
Based upon past
experience with the CCM core group, we anticipate needing four
programmers for these purposes and propose bringing onboard such people
over the course of the start-up period, i.e. the first two
years. At steady state, about 360K per year would be needed for the
duration of the CSM project. These
programmers may eventually be combined with the existing CCM core
group to support all aspects of the CSM.
</p>

<p>
In order to promote active participation by
university faculty and training of young scientists we propose that
a minimum of two long term visitor and two postdoctoral positions
should be funded (300K per year). These positions could be
coordinated through UCAR-CSMP in order to broaden the the outreach to
the scientific community and to reduce overhead.
</p>

<p>
The CSM project also requires resources for
short-term visitors collaborating with NCAR scientists on CSM
development and analyses and for those wanting hands-on experience with the
model (50K per year). Regular workshops 
on the model and its use are needed to stimulate the
involvement of a broader spectrum of users and to increase their
understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the CSM (24K, every
other year). Finally,
the CSM core group and visitors will need adequate workstations to
work effectively (25K per year).
</p>


<b><a name="Computing">Computing Requirements</a></b>

<p>
A comprehensive CSM will be computationally expensive.  The
development of any complex model, such as the CSM, inevitably involves
compromises either to control computational costs, or because of
insufficient scientific understanding.  
Below we show an estimate of the computational cost of the components
in the first implementation of a modest-resolution CSM version 1. We
also discuss, component by component, the rationale for these choices
as well as give an indication of the relative costs of other (future)
choices. It should be remarked that it is relatively straight-forward
to enhance the resolution of any of the components and, for some
climate issues, this will be required.
</p>

<p>
Several strategies are being followed to limit the expense of the CSM,
such as intermediate horizontal resolution and limited complexity. The
target resolutions for the atmospheric components have been chosen
near the minimum resolutions at which credible representations of the
most important large scale dynamical processes are possible.  The only
chemical or biogeochemical option which will probably be incorporated
in coupled simulations during the startup phase is an extremely
simplified treatment of the atmospheric concentrations of the principal
greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosol. More detailed chemistry and
biogeochemistry will be tested primarily in uncoupled simulations
until both significant skill and a need for coupling is demonstrated.
Nevertheless, the CSM will tax the capabilities of currently available
supercomputers.  As increasing computer power is available, pioneering
calculations with higher resolution and increased complexity will be
performed. However, assuming that the important dynamical and
thermodynamical processes are adequately represented, more will be
learned from frequent simulations at modest resolution than from one
or two simulations at the highest possible resolution. It is extremely
important that a large proportion of the available computing time be
used for multiple simulations in order to understand the model
behavior and its sensitivity to a variety of parameter choices.
</p>

<p>
The computational cost of the physical components of the climate system
are reasonably well known because relatively mature models exist. 
The initial configuration of the CSM has been designed so that
the physical climate system from the ocean floor to the middle
stratosphere can be simulated on the existing computers in the CSL. 
However, transient greenhouse gas experiments will stretch the
available capacity to the limit. For example, a 150 year integration
from preindustrial greenhouse gas concentrations would take about 2
months on a dedicated YMP8.
</p>

<p>COMPUTATIONAL REQUIREMENTS<br>
YMP Processor hours / simulated year
</p>


<p>
The computational costs of the chemical and biogeochemical components
of the climate system are not well known because only prototype models
currently exist. However, it is certain that any reasonably
comprehensive treatment of these processes will be expensive. The cost
of treating chemical compounds in three-dimensional models can be
easily seen from the increase in the required number of variables. An
atmospheric or oceanic GCM needs three dimensional equations to
predict only 4 variables: zonal and meridional momentum, temperature,
and water vapor or salt concentration. In addition, the vertical
velocity must be diagnosed.  Each chemical compound whose
concentration must be advected adds an additional three dimensional
variable and could be expected to add about 20 to the computational
cost. The actual increase is generally less than 20 because the
parameterized physics in the GCM significantly increase its basic cost
and the numerics can often eliminate redundant calculations for
additional variables. However, it is clear that simulating
the concentrations of the principal greenhouse gases will be time
consuming, even with highly simplified chemistry and biogeochemistry
and limited numbers of constituents.
</p>



<p><b>How Increased Computer Resources Can Be Used</b></p>

<p>1.  Atmosphere</p>


<p>Dynamics</p>

<p>
The advent of semi-Lagrange dynamics
allows an increase of the spectral truncation to T63 with no increase in
cost. Developing of a reduced grid (at the poles) model will allow a
further modest increase in resolution (or decrease in cost).  At least
a factor of five increase in computing power would be required to make
a significant increase in the horizontal resolution.
</p>

<p>
The vertical domain can be increased to include the full
stratosphere and lower mesosphere at about 2.5 times the cost of the
standard model. This increase will be required for a credible
treatment of ozone chemistry and its effects on climate.
</p>


<p><b>Physics</b></p>

<p>
The radiative transfer parameterization is fairly detailed for both
solar and long wave radiation. The long wave effects of the principal
greenhouse gases are being included and the short wave effects of
aerosols can be included easily in the short wave without
significantly altering the cost.
</p>

<p>
The boundary layer employs one of the best available 
parameterizations for models with modest vertical resolution. A modest
increase in vertical resolution ( 10) would improve the
ability to represent the boundary layer depth and turbulent fluxes,
but little more computational cost is required unless significantly
better parameterizations are developed.
</p>

<p>
The treatment of convection in CCM2 is particularly simple and
more elaborate (and expensive) schemes are being tested. A significant
increase in the model cost (10--20) will probably be required to
incorporate a better convection, if the benefits can be demonstrated.
</p>


<p><b>Chemistry</b></p>

<p>
Atmospheric chemistry can use enormous amounts of computing
power. Each chemical species added to the model must be advected by
the dynamics and mixed vertically by the boundary layer and
convection. Computing chemical and photolytic reaction rates can also
be very expensive, especially when expensive algorithms are required
to deal with the numerical problems posed by reaction time scales
which vary from nanoseconds to hours or longer.
</p>

<p>
A reasonably comprehensive treatment of
stratospheric ozone chemistry approximately doubles the cost of the
model even though the chemistry is still somewhat simplified and
highly optimized. Half of the cost increase results from
including the photochemical reactions and half results from the
cost of transporting 14 chemical constituents in the GCM.
</p>

<p>
Detailed tropospheric chemistry
will be much more expensive both in terms of the number of species
which must be advected, and in terms of the computational cost of
chemistry itself.
</p>

<p>
The initial CSM will include only
a highly simplified chemistry for the principal greenhouse
gas and sulphate
aerosol.  Even this limited set will probably represent  50
of the cost of the atmospheric model.
</p>

<p>
More detailed chemical models will
be pursued outside the coupled model framework, but may require
greatly expanded ( 5--10 times) computer resources for significant
advances.
</p>



<p><b>2.</b> <b><a name="Ocean">Ocean</a></b>


<p><b>Physics</b></p>

<p>
The mesoscale eddy parameterization included in the ocean model
results in considerable net savings in computation time. The increase
in the accuracy of the simulation of many large scale ocean
properties, including the poleward heat fluxes, allows the model to be
run at coarser horizontal resolution than would be possible in a model
employing only a standard horizontal diffusion in height coordinates.
The reduction in horizontal resolution easily offsets the 40
increase in computation time resulting from the 
calculation of the density slopes
required by the eddy parameterization.
</p>

<p>
The next major change in the model physics will be the inclusion
of an ocean boundary layer, similar in nature to the atmospheric
boundary layer included in the atmosphere component. The boundary
layer parameterization will increase the cost of the ocean model by a
further 25, based on initial testing, but should greatly improve the
accuracy of the simulation of vertical mixing in the upper layers of
the ocean.
</p>


<p><b>Numerics</b></p>

<p>
An acceleration technique has been used to run the ocean model to
equilibrium with fixed atmospheric forcing. The ocean adjustment time
increases as a function of depth to about 1000--3000 years for the
deep ocean. The acceleration technique allows deep ocean
temperature and salinity timesteps 100 times greater than the
time step for the upper layer ocean velocities. This technique has
been shown to work well in obtaining equilibrium solutions under
constant forcing conditions but cannot be used in coupled model runs
because of the variations in atmospheric  forcing. Indeed, several
coupled modeling groups have abandoned acceleration techniques
entirely because of concerns that it leads to the wrong equilibrium
solution when even seasonal variations in forcing are included. This
means that ocean component of the coupled simulations will take much
longer (10--100 times) than ocean spinup runs of comparable length.
</p>

<p>
Most of the early CSM simulations will be run at a horizontal
resolution in the ocean model of 2longitude and averaging 
2latitude (higher near the equator and at high latitudes, lower in
midlatitudes).  Some simulations will be performed at half of this grid
spacing ( 1), but clearly neither configuration resolves ocean
eddies, which is the reason that the mesoscale eddy parameterization has
been included. If an eddy resolving global
ocean model is considered, then the computation cost would increase
enormously. Although considerable success at simulating ocean eddies
has been achieved at 1/6resolution, truly eddy resolving models
will require 1/10resolution and cost at least 400 times more than
the 2model being used in the initial CSM simulations.
</p>

<p>
The ocean model is a considerable compromise in horizontal
resolution. The ability to represent some of the important processes
involved in ENSO has been sacrificed to achieve an affordable cost.
Since the model has a minimum latitudinal spacing of 1.2near the
equator, it cannot adequately resolve the equatorial wave guide and is
not expected to be able to represent some of the essential dynamics
of tropical Pacific variability. Experience suggests that the 1
model, with it's 0.6equatorial resolution, will be required to
properly represent ENSO.
</p>

<p>
The 45 level vertical resolution of the ocean model is
considerably greater than that being used by most other coupled
modeling groups. This resolution has been chosen to represent
the crucial effects of variations in the ocean depth on the
circulation and, particularly, on water mass formation. Many aspects
of the ocean circulation are determined by the restrictions on the
flow produced by shallow sills and the isolation of basins by
intervening ridges. 
</p>

<p>
Other issues, such as alternative advection algorithms, filtering
schemes and vertical coordinates would not greatly affect the
computational cost of the ocean model.
</p>


<p><b>Biogeochemistry</b></p>


<p>
The simplest ocean biogeochemistry calculations using an abiotic,
inorganic CO2 model increase the cost of the ocean model by 40.
</p>

<p>
Early tests using a marine ecosystem model adapted from the
``Fasham'' model have shown that it increases the ocean model cost by
a factor of 3. 
</p>

<p>
Inclusion of a full-depth biotic carbon and nitrogen-based
ecosystem model would probably increase the computational cost of the
ocean model by a factor of 5.
</p>


<p><b>3.</b> <b><a name="Land">Land Surface</a></b>

<p><b>Physics</b></p>

<p>
The land surface grid is currently the same as the horizontal
resolution of
the atmosphere (approximately 2.8 x 2.8). Moving the land
surface
to its own grid with finer resolution would allow for better 
characterization of vegetation and soil inhomogeneities that are
thought
to significantly affect land-atmosphere interactions. However, this
gain
in spatial resolution is expense. A 2 x 2 grid
increases the overhead of the land surface model by a factor of two;
a 1 x 1 grid increases the overhead by a factor of eight.
</p>


<p>
Most land surface models simulate the average soil water within
a grid box. Independent of the horizontal resolution of the land, the 
distribution of soil water within a grid box and the non-linearities
associated with surface fluxes and soil hydrology need to be
considered.
Simplying adding two subgrid fractions (wet, dry) with explicit
surface flux calculations and hydrology for each fraction
would increase the overhead of the land surface model by a factor of
two.
</p>

<p>
Empirical and theoretical studies suggest the terrestrial fresh water
flux into oceans is an important determinant of past climatic changes.
Models that transport runoff from individual land surface points to 
appropriate oceans are being developed and must be included in future
CSM activities. The cost of these models is not known, but can be high
if one fully represents the two-dimensional lateral transport of water
between grid boxes.
</p>


<p><b>Biogeochemistry</b></p>

<p>
The land surface model simulates CO fluxes associated with plant
photosynthesis, plant respiration, and microbial respiration, and the
feedbacks from the nitrogen cyclke that govern transient responses.
This model will also serve as a platfrom for the eventual simulation
of biogenic CH, NO, NO, and hydrocarbon fluxes.  One of
the future tasks for the CSM is to use these fluxes to simulate
atmospheric CO concentrations. The cost of adding an inert
chemical constituent such as CO to the atmosphere is approximately 1.2 CPU hours per
simulated year.
</p>

<p>
The cost of running a complete terrestrial ecosystem model at T42
resolution is approximately 1 CPU hour per simulated year.
</p>

<p><b>4. Sea Ice</b></p>

<p>
The initial sea ice component of CSM will use a cavitating fluid
rheology, partly to reduce the computation time. Developments such as
full rheology physics and more advanced thermodynamics are likely in
the near future. These developments may increase the computational
cost of the sea ice model several times, but it will remain small
compared to other components of the CSM.
