1 April 2010 - Perturbation growth simulation.

source code: CAM-4.0 public distribution

platform: NCAR-bluefire (IBM POWER6)
uname -a: AIX be1105en 3 5 00CBB5014C00
fortran : IBM XL Fortran for AIX, V12.1

CAM configuration:

% configure -dyn fv -hgrid 1.9x2.5 -ntasks 16 -nthreads 4 -pergro

Control run:

The parallel configuration is hybrid mpi/omp.  The run was done using 1
node (32-way w/ SMT) with 16 tasks per node, and 4 threads per task.

% build-namelist -s -case cam4.0_control -runtype startup \
 -namelist "&camexp stop_option='ndays', stop_n=2 nhtfrq=1 ndens=1 \
   mfilt=145 hfilename_spec='h%t.nc' empty_htapes=.true. \
   fincl1='T:I','PS:I' aqua_planet=.true. /"

The history file was renamed to f1.9ph_ibm.nc.

Perturbation run:

% build-namelist -s -case cam4.0_control -runtype startup \
 -namelist "&camexp stop_option='ndays', stop_n=2 nhtfrq=1 ndens=1 \
   mfilt=145 hfilename_spec='h%t.nc' empty_htapes=.true. \
   fincl1='T:I','PS:I' aqua_planet=.true. pertlim=1.e-14 /"

The RMS temperature differences between the control and perturbation runs
were generated by the utility cprncdf, and written to the output file
RMST_f1.9ph_ibm_aqpgro.
