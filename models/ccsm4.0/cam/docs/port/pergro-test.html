<h1>Perturbation Growth Test Procedure</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>It is often of interest to validate that the
difference between two model runs is due only to machine epsilon (i.e.,
roundoff) size differences that could have been introduced by, for example,
</p>

<ul>
<li>running the same code on different machine architectures,
</li>
<li>running the same code on the same machine architectures, but with different
compilation or runtime environments, or
</li>
<li>running two code versions that have only structural or perhaps order of
operation differences on the same machine.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The nature of global atmospheric models such as CAM is that small
solution differences grow rapidly, and hence can hide small errors due to
coding, computer system, or porting.  The perturbation growth test
described here [<a href=#Ros97>Ros97</a>] was designed as an inexpensive
test to give reasonable confidence that solution differences are due only
to rounding differences.  There are, however, two important points to keep
in mind.
</p>

<ul>

<li>A successful test is <em>not sufficient</em> to guarantee that model
solution differences are due only to roundoff differences.  Reasons for
this include the following.

<ul>
<li>Some parameterizations in CAM are extremely sensitive to small
perturbations, and in order to have CAM produce simulations that exhibit
"acceptable" perturbation growth, it must be run in a special configuration
in which some code is disabled via a CPP macro (<code>PERGRO</code>).
</li>
<li>The CLM is extremely sensitive to small perturbations and so the tests are
done in "aqua-planet" mode which eliminates interaction with the land
model.
</li>
<li>The length of the test is only two days which will only produce a
subset of possible atmospheric states, and can't exercise all the code switches
that control things like reading boundary datasets.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, not all of CAM's production code is exercised by this test.</p>
</li>

<li>Models producing simulations that are the "same to roundoff"
(defined as simulations that pass this test) are not guaranteed to produce
the same climate.  Validating a model's climate still requires that climate
simulations and diagnostics be performed.
</li>

</ul>

<p>In spite of the preceding disclaimers, the perturbation growth test is a
valuable tool because:
</p>

<ul>
<li> it reliably points out when there is a problem that is making larger
than roundoff size changes to the solution, and
</li>
<li>it verifies when a change in the solution is characteristic of the
change we expect from roundoff level differences.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test Description</h3>

<p>To perform the test requires three model simulations, each two days in
duration.  The first two are done with the control (trusted) model and
differ due to a perturbation introduced into the lowest-order bits of the
initial values of the temperature field of one of the runs.  The difference
between these simulations, as measured by the time evolution of the RMS
temperature difference, is used to characterize the perturbation growth of
the control model.  The third run is done with the model being tested.  The
difference between the test simulation and either of the simulations from
the control model characterizes the growth of the difference between the
models.
</p>

<p>We say that the test simulation is "within roundoff" of the control
simulation if the difference growth does not substantially exceed the
perturbation growth.  Unfortunately, we can't be more precise than
"substantially exceed".  After gaining alot of practical experience doing
tests of this type, we often find that the difference and perturbation
growth curves will lie nearly on top of one another with the perturbation
curve lying above the difference curve at times, and lying below it at
other times.
</p>

<p>The main reason we find this test so useful is that when it fails it
generally fails spectacularly, i.e., the difference curve will exceed the
perturbation curve by many orders of magnitude within a few model
timesteps.  On the other hand, a "passed" test may be fuzzy, for example,
when the difference curve is consistently above the perturbation curve, but
never exceeds it by more than an order of magnitude.  As mentioned
previously, at this point it's time to perform a full blown climate
validation.
</p>

<h3>Procedure Details</h3>

<p>Below the procedure to perform a perturbation growth test is described
in detail.  The example illustrates the test for the T42 Eulerian dycore,
but any dycore, resolution, or constituent scenario could be used.
</p>

<ol>

<li><span class="title">Configure CAM - </span> 
To build CAM for perturbation growth testing the configure command
<em>must</em> be invoked with the <code>-pergro</code> option (in addition
to any options that are specific to the model configuration being tested).
<br><pre>
% configure -pergro
</pre>
</li>

<li><span class="title">Run CAM - </span>
Three two-day simulations are required:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Run the control model with no perturbation applied to the initial
conditions.</li>
<li>Run the control model with a perturbation applied to the initial
temperature field.</li>
<li>Run the model being tested with no perturbation applied to the initial
conditions.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The namelist for a two day run with no perturbation applied to the initial
conditions is set up as follows:
</p>
<pre>
% build-namelist -s -case camrun -runtype startup \
 -namelist "&camexp stop_option='ndays', stop_n=2 nhtfrq=1 ndens=1 \
   mfilt=97 hfilename_spec='h%t.nc' empty_htapes=.true. \
   fincl1='T:I','PS:I' aqua_planet=.true. /"
</pre>
<p>This specifies a two-day initial run, in "aqua-planet" mode, with real*8
precision output of just the T and PS fields at every timestep.  Additional
variables set for convenience specify writing history output every timestep, 
writing all timesteps to one output file, use 64-bit NetCDF format for output, 
and renaming the history file to 'h0.nc'.  Note
that output of the PS field is required for computing the difference
statistic which is a mass weighted RMS value.
</p>
<p>The namelist for a two day run with a perturbation applied to the
initial temperature field is set up just as above, but with the added
namelist variable "<code>pertlim=1.e-14</code>".
</p>
</li>

<li><span class="title">Compute RMS temperature differences - </span>
The following mass weighted RMS temperature differences need to be computed:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The difference between the two control model runs, one with no
perturbation applied and the second with a perturbed initial temperature
field.  This difference is used to plot the perturbation growth curve.
</li>
<li>The difference between either run with the control model, and the run
with the test model.  This difference is used to plot the difference growth
curve.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Mass weighted RMS differences for all fields in two CAM history files
are computed using the tool <code>cprnc</code> which is distributed with
CAM (in the <code>models/atm/cam/tools/cprnc</code> directory).  The output
from <code>cprnc</code> will contain a line formatted as follows for each
temperature timesample in the two files:
</p>
<pre>
 MASS WEIGHTED RMS T        6.6882E-12
</pre>

<p>A tool can be written in the user's favorite scripting language to strip
the RMS values from the <code>cprnc</code> output to make them available
for plotting.  An example of such a tool, <a
href="pergro-utils.tar.gz"><code>cprncdf</code></a>, is a perl script
which, if given one filename argument, assumes that the file contains
output from <code>cprnc</code> and strips the RMS T values from the file.
If <code>cprncdf</code> is given two filename arguments it assumes they are
CAM history files on which it invokes <code>cprnc</code> and then processes
its output.  <code>cprncdf</code> writes output which looks
like this to stdout:
</p>
<pre>
e48pm_lf_aqpgro
e48ph_aqpgro
T
0 4.9115E-12
1 5.8276E-12
2 6.6468E-12
3 5.0961E-12
...
</pre>

<p>The 3 header lines are comprised of the case names from each of the runs
and the name of the variable that the RMS values are for.
(<code>cprncdf</code> has a command-line option that allows outputting the
RMS differences of any variable in the two files.)  Then there is a line
for each timesample in the files for which the RMS value is not zero.  The
first value in the line is the timestep number, followed by the RMS value.
</p>
</li>

<li><span class="title">Plot RMS temperature differences - </span> The
final step is to compare the perturbation and difference growth curves.
Any plotting tool with the ability to create semi-log line plots is
sufficient.  An example of such a tool, <a href="pergro-utils.tar.gz">
<code>cprncplt</code></a>, is a perl script which reads files in the format
generated by <code>cprncdf</code> (one file for each line in the plot) and
then invokes a scientific data processing and plotting tool called <a
href="ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/Yorick/doc/index.html">
<code>yorick</code></a> to do the plotting.  <code>yorick</code> must be
installed on your system for this script to be used.
