<acronym class="acronym">CAM</acronym> produces a series of <acronym class="acronym">NetCDF</acronym> format history files containing
atmospheric gridpoint data generated during the course of a run. It
also produces a series of <acronym class="acronym">NetCDF</acronym> format restart files necessary to continue a
run once it has terminated successfully and a series of initial
conditions files that may be used to initialize new simulations. The
contents of these datasets are described below.  
</p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="hist_files"></a>4.1. Model History Files</h2></div></div></div><p>
History files contain model data values written at specified frequencies
during a run.  Options are also available to record averaged,
instantaneous, maximum, or minimum values on a field-by-field basis.  If
the user wishes to see a field written at more than one time frequency
(e.g. daily, hourly), additional history files must be declared.  This
functionality is available via setting namelist variables.
</p><p>
History files may be visualized using various commercial or freely
available tools.  Examples include the the NCAR Graphics package (via NCL),
CDAT, FERRET, ncview, MATLAB, and IDL. For a list of software tools
for interacting with NetCDF files, view the <acronym class="acronym">UNIDATA</acronym> maintained link

<acronym class="acronym">CAM</acronym> writes a sequence of time samples
to each of its specified history files.  There can
currently be from one to six history file streams, and each stream has its
own set of the following attributes:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

output precision (4-byte or 8-byte floats)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>
Each time sample in a history file has an associated timestamp which
conforms to the <a class="ulink" href="http://cfconventions.org/" target="_top"><acronym class="acronym">CF</acronym> metadata
conventions</a>.  The time unit used in <acronym class="acronym">CAM</acronym>'s output files is
"days since reference date" where the reference date is the run start date
by default, but can be customized via the <code class="varname">ref_ymd</code> and <code class="varname">ref_tod</code> namelist
variables.  The variables relevant to the timestamps are the following
(from the output of the <acronym class="acronym">NetCDF</acronym> <span class="command"><strong>ncdump</strong></span> utility):
</p><pre class="screen">
        double time(time) ;
                time:long_name = "time" ;
                time:units = "days since 0000-01-01 00:00:00" ;
                time:calendar = "noleap" ;
                time:bounds = "time_bnds" ;

        double time_bnds(time, nbnd) ;
                time_bnds:long_name = "time interval endpoints" ;

        int date(time) ;
                date:long_name = "current date (YYYYMMDD)" ;

        int datesec(time) ;
                datesec:long_name = "current seconds of current date" ;
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The variable names, <code class="varname">time</code>, <code class="varname">time_bnds</code>, <code class="varname">date</code>, and <code class="varname">datesec</code> are all
local conventions.  What makes the history files <acronym class="acronym">CF</acronym> compliant is that the
time coordinate, <code class="varname">time</code>, can be identified by it's units attribute "days
since 0000-01-01 00:00:00".  The reference date is in the form YYYY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS where YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS are year, month, day, hour, minute,
second respectively, and a missing timezone defaults to UTC.  The
<code class="varname">calendar</code> and <code class="varname">bounds</code> attributes are also part of <acronym class="acronym">CF</acronym>.  The <code class="varname">calendar</code>
value "<code class="literal">noleap</code>" denotes the Gregorian calendar with no leap years.  The
<code class="varname">bounds</code> value <code class="varname">time_bnds</code> denotes that the variable with the name
<code class="varname">time_bnds</code> contains the timestamps that bound the time intervals over
which an operation such as computing an averager or a minimum or maximum
value has been applied.  Whether or not the interval specified by
<code class="varname">time_bnds</code> is relevent depends on the individual variables, e.g., a single
file can contain both instantaneous and time averaged fields.  The type of
the time operation that has been applied is contained in the <code class="varname">cell_methods</code>
attribute of each variable, e.g.,

</p><pre class="screen">
        float T(time, lev, lat, lon) ;
                T:mdims = 1 ;
                T:units = "K" ;
                T:long_name = "Temperature" ;
                T:cell_methods = "time: mean" ;
</pre><p>

The <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> attribute for the temperature variable indicates that it
is being output as a time averaged field.  If temperature was instantaneous
then the <code class="varname">cell_methods</code> attribute would not be present since instantaneous
is the default.
</p><p>
The variables <code class="varname">date</code> and <code class="varname">datesec</code> are for convenience only; they don't
play any role in terms of <acronym class="acronym">CF</acronym> compliance.  The <code class="varname">date</code> variable is an
integer which is encoded to contain the digits YYYYMMDD where YYYY, MM, and
DD are the year, month, and day of month respectively.  <code class="varname">datesec</code> is
the integer number of seconds past 0Z in the current day.  The variables
<code class="varname">date</code> and <code class="varname">datesec</code> are redundant in the sense that they can be recovered
from the <code class="varname">time</code> variable via a date calculation using the specified
calendar.

<span class="emphasis"><em>The timestamp associated with each time sample in a history file
is the model time at the end of the timestep during which the model writes
data to the disk</em></span>.  In the case of instantaneous data the meaning
is clear.  However when the data is representative of a time interval, the
timestamp corresponds to <span class="emphasis"><em>the end of the interval</em></span>.
</p><p>
This is often a point of confusion when looking at history files.  Since
the endpoint of one interval is the same as the begining of the next
interval, when looking at a monthly average for January, which has a
timestamp of 0Z on Feb 01, at first glance the timestamp would seem to
correspond to a February average.  Hence it's important for post processing
tools to make use of the data in the <code class="varname">time_bnds</code> variable so that the time
interval endpoints can be used to compute an interval midpoint which is the
more appropriate timestamp to associate with the interval.

<acronym class="acronym">CAM</acronym>'s default history output is a sequence of monthly averaged fields,
written with one time sample per file.  This restriction is related to the
default file naming scheme which uses the string "YYYY-MM" to indicate the
year and month of the average contained in the file.  However in general it
is possible to write multiple time samples in any of the history file
streams that don't contain monthly time intervals.  However there is one
somewhat unexpected "feature" of multiple time sample files that we wish to
point out here.
</p><div class="example"><a id="timestamps_daily_avg"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 4.2. Timestamps for five daily averages</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><p>

Instead of ending up with a file containing five time samples, i.e., a
daily average for each of the first five days of January, we get six time
samples.  The first one looks a bit strange since the time bounds are
indicating an interval of zero duration.  But in fact that's correct for the
first time sample which is instantaneous data representing the initial
conditions which have only been modify by a partial first step up to the
point of the radiation calculation.  This "extra" time sample from the
initialization phase is included in every history file except for the
monthly average file.  An unfortunate consequence of this extra time sample
is that it's not possible to create a sequence of files with the same
number of time intervals since the first file in the sequence will always
have one fewer time interval than the rest due to the inclusion of the time
zero sample.

<acronym class="acronym">CAM</acronym> is set up by default to output a set of fields to a single monthly
average history file.  There is a much larger set of available fields,
known as the "master field list," from which the user can choose fields of
interest to add to the history file via namelist settings.  Both the set of
default fields and the master field list depend on how <acronym class="acronym">CAM</acronym> is configured.
Due to the large number of fields we have chosen to make lists of fields
for some standard configuration available via linked documents rather than
to inline the lists here.  Each of the field list documents is comprised of
tables containing the lists of fields that are output by default as well as
the master field list.
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>
The master field list tables may contain some fields that are not actually
available for output.  The presence of a field in the master field list is
a necessary, but not sufficient condition that the corresponding field in
the history file will contain valid data.  This is because in some
instances fields are added to the master field list (this is done in the
source code) even though that field may not be computed in the
configuration that is built (specified via the arguments to <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span>).
When adding non-default fields to the history file it's important to check
that the fields contain reasonable data before doing a long run.
</p><p>
The following links provide tables of default and master field lists for
some standard model configurations which are characterized by the values of
the <code class="option">-dyn</code>, <code class="option">-phys</code>,
and <code class="option">-chem</code> arguments to <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span>.  The source of the
information in these tables is <acronym class="acronym">CAM</acronym>'s default log file, so you can always
look there for any configuration not included in the list below.
