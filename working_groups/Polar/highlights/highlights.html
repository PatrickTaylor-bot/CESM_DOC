<p>        A climate model (CCSM4) is used to investigate the influence of
anthropogenic forcing on late 20th century and early 21st century Arctic sea
ice extent trends.  On all timescales examined (2-50+ years), the most
extreme negative observed late 20th century trends cannot be explained by
modeled natural variability alone.  Modeled late 20th century ice extent
loss also cannot be explained by natural causes alone, but the six available
CCSM4 ensemble members exhibit a large spread in their late 20th century ice
extent loss.  Comparing trends from the CCSM4 ensemble to observed trends
suggests that internal variability explains approximately half of the
observed 1979-2005 September Arctic sea ice extent loss. In a warming
world, CCSM4 shows that multi-decadal negative trends increase in frequency
and magnitude, and that trend variability on 2-10 year timescales increases
(Figure 1).  Furthermore, when internal variability counteracts
anthropogenic forcing, positive trends on 2-20 year timescales occur until
the middle of the 21st century.

<p>
We test sea ice reversibility within a state‐of‐the‐art atmosphere–ocean
global climate model (CCSM3) by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide until
the Arctic Ocean becomes ice‐free throughout the year and subsequently decreasing it until the initial ice cover returns. Evidence for
irreversibility in the form of hysteresis outside the envelope of natural
variability is explored for the loss of summer and winter ice in both
hemispheres. We find no evidence of irreversibility or multiple ice‐cover
states over the full range of simulated sea ice conditions between the
modern climate and that with an annually ice‐free Arctic Ocean. Summer sea
ice area recovers as hemispheric temperature cools along a trajectory that
is indistinguishable from the trajectory of summer sea ice loss, while the
recovery of winter ice area appears to be slowed due to the long response
times of the ocean near the modern winter ice edge. These findings serve as
evidence against the existence of threshold (or 'tipping point') behavior in
the summer or winter ice cover in either hemisphere.

<p>In CCSM4 the most notable improvements to the sea ice model are the
incorporation of a new shortwave radiative transfer scheme and the
capabilities that this enables. This scheme uses inherent optical
properties to define scattering and absorption characteristics of snow, ice and included shortwave absorbers and explicitly allows for melt ponds
and aerosols. The deposition and cycling of aerosols in sea ice is now
included and a new parameterization derives ponded water from the surface
meltwater flux. Taken together, this provides a more sophisticated,
accurate, and complete treatment of sea ice radiative transfer. In
preindustrial simulations, the radiative impact of ponds and aerosols on
Arctic sea ice is 1.1 W/m2 annually, with aerosols accounting for up to 8
W/m2 enhanced June shortwave absorption in the Barents/Kara Seas, and with
ponds accounting for over 10 W/m2 in shelf regions in July. In 2XCO2
simulations with the same aerosol deposition, ponds have a larger effect
whereas aerosol effects are reduced, thereby modifying the surface albedo
feedback. While the direct forcing is modest, because aerosols and ponds
influence the albedo, the response is amplified. In simulations with no
ponds or aerosols in sea ice, the Arctic ice is over a meter thicker and
retains more summer ice cover. Diagnosis of a 20th century simulation
(FIGURE) indicates an increased radiative forcing from aerosols and melt
ponds, which could play a role in 20th century Arctic sea ice reductions.
In contrast, ponds and aerosol deposition have little effect on Antarctic
sea ice for all climates considered.

<p>Vavrus, S. J., M. M. Holland, A. Jahn, D. A. Bailey, and B. A. Blazey, 2011: 21st-Century Arctic Climate Change in CCSM4. J. Climate, in revision.</p>

<p>We summarize the 21st-century Arctic climate simulated by the latest version
of NCAR’s Community Climate System Model, CCSM4.  Under a strong radiative
forcing scenario, the model simulates a much warmer, wetter, cloudier, and
stormier Arctic climate with considerably less sea ice and a fresher Arctic
Ocean.  The high correlation among the variables comprising these changes---temperature, precipitation, cloudiness, sea level pressure (SLP),
and ice concentration---suggests that their close coupling collectively
represents a fingerprint of Arctic climate change.  Although the projected
changes in CCSM4 are generally consistent with those in other GCMs, we
identify several noteworthy features. Despite more global warming in CCSM4,
Arctic changes are generally less than under comparable greenhouse forcing
in CCSM3, as represented by Arctic amplification (16% weaker) and the date
of a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean (20 years later).  Autumn is the
season of most pronounced Arctic climate change among all the primary
variables. The changes are very similar across the five ensemble members,
although SLP displays the largest internal variability. The SLP response
exhibits a significant trend toward stronger extreme Arctic cyclones,
implying greater wave activity that would promote coastal erosion. Based on
a commonly used definition of the Arctic (the area encompassing the 10oC
July air temperature isotherm), the region shrinks by about 40% during the
21st century, in conjunction with a nearly 10 K warming trend poleward of
70oN.  Despite this pronounced long-term warming, CCSM4 simulates a hiatus
in the secular Arctic climate trends during a decade-long stretch in the
2040s and to a lesser extent in the 2090s.  These pauses occur despite
averaging over five ensemble members and are remarkable because they happen
under the most extreme greenhouse-forcing scenario and in the most
climatically sensitive region of the world.</p>

<p>Recent work indicates that climate models have a positive bias in the
strength of the winter-time low-level temperature inversion over the
high-latitude northern hemisphere. It has been argued this bias leads to
underestimates of the Arctic's surface temperature response to anthropogenic
forcing. Here the bias in inversion strength is revisited. The spatial
distribution of low-level stability is found to be bimodal in climate models
and observational reanalysis products, with low-level inversions represented
by a stable primary mode over the interior Arctic Ocean and adjacent
continents, and a secondary unstable mode over the Atlantic Ocean. Averaging
over these differing conditions is detrimental to understanding the origins
of the inversion strength bias. While nearly all of the 21 models examined
overestimate the area-average inversion strength, conditionally sampling the
two modes shows about half the models overestimate the inversion strength
because of geographical biases and half because of errors in the
representation of the Arctic boundary layer. The geographic biases are
likely tied to errors in the large-scale circulation, and are connected to
the distribution of sea-ice which separates the stable and unstable regimes.
This analysis improves understanding of this ubiquitous climate model error,
and connects the error to different aspects of the models. This can help to
focus model development by focusing attention on processes that lead to the
errors in inversion strength.</p>

<p> Simulation of key features of the Arctic atmosphere in
the fourth version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) is
evaluated against observational and reanalysis datasets for the present-day
(1981-2005). Surface air temperature, sea level pressure, cloud cover
and phase, precipitation and evaporation, the atmospheric energy budget and
lower tropospheric stability are evaluated. Simulated surface air
temperatures are found to be slightly too cold 15 when compared with ERA-40.
Spatial patterns and temporal variability are well simulated. Evaluation of
the sea level pressure demonstrates some large biases, most noticeably an
under-simulation of the Beaufort High during spring and autumn. Monthly
Arctic-wide biases of up to 13 mb are reported. Cloud cover is
under-predicted for all but summer 19 months, and cloud phase is
demonstrated to be different from observations. Despite low cloud cover,
simulated all-sky liquid water paths are too high, while ice water path
was generally too low. Precipitation is found to be excessive over much of
the Arctic compared to ERA-40 and GPCP estimates. With some exceptions,
evaporation is well captured by CCSM4, resulting in P-E estimates that are
too high. CCSM4 energy budget terms show promising agreement with estimates
from several sources. The most noticeable exception to this are TOA fluxes that are found to be too low while surface fluxes are found to be too high
during summer months. Finally, the lower troposphere is found to be too
stable when compared to ERA-40 during all times of year, but particularly
during spring and summer months.</p>

Thordarson, 2011: Abrupt onset of the Little Ice Age triggered by volcanism and sustained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks. Geophys. Res. Let., in review.</p>

<p>The CCSM3 is used to show that abrupt regional cooling in the Arctic during the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1250-1800 AD) could be initiated by explosive volcanism and maintained by subsequent sea-ice/ocean feedbacks.  With a favorable initial state, two transient simulations (1150-1625/1700 AD) forced solely by stratospheric volcanic aerosols resulted in a continuously sustained sea-ice expansion following the late 13th Century eruptions, a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) by 1350 AD, and an anomalously cold and fresh subpolar gyre that persists through the simulations. The apparent sensitivity of the sea-ice/ocean feedback on the initial state suggests that the state of natural modes of climate variability may determine whether the climate impacts from explosive volcanism extend well beyond their initial primary radiative effects.</p>

<p>Do changes in atmospheric poleward energy transports explain the large
range in Arctic amplification seen in CMIP3 simulations?  Definitely
not.  In fact, models with more polar amplification in 21st century
projections show significantly less atmospheric energy transport into the Arctic (Figure 1a). Enhanced Arctic warming weakens the
equator-to-pole temperature gradient and decreases atmospheric dry
static energy transport, a decrease that often outweighs increases
from atmospheric moisture transport. Increasing oceanic transport in
most models is positively correlated with Arctic amplification (Figure
1b); however, the increase is too small to compensate the decrease of
atmospheric energy transport and the causality of the positive
correlation needs further investigation. Model spread in total energy
transport cannot explain the model spread in polar amplification;
models with great polar amplification must instead have stronger local
feedbacks. Because local feedbacks affect temperature gradients,
coupling between energy transports and Arctic feedbacks cannot be
neglected when studying Arctic amplification.</p>

<p>To establish how well the new Community Climate System model version 4 (CCSM4) simulates the properties of the Arctic sea ice and ocean, we compared results from a six-member CCSM4 20th century ensemble with available data. We find that the CCSM4 simulations capture most of the important climatological features of the Arctic sea ice and ocean state well, among them the sea-ice thickness distribution, the fraction of multiyear sea ice, and the sea-ice edge. The strongest bias exists in the simulated spring to fall sea-ice motion field, the location of the Beaufort Gyre, and the temperature of the deep Arctic Ocean (below 250 m), which are caused by deficiencies in the simulation of the Arctic sea-level pressure field and the lack of deep-water formation on the Arctic shelves. The observed decrease in the sea-ice extent and of the multiyear ice cover is also well captured by the CCSM4.
Looking at the spread between the six ensemble members, we found that the temporal evolution of the simulated Arctic sea-ice cover over the satellite era is strongly influenced by internal variability. One example is the sea-ice thickness at the end of the 20th centurt simulation, which shows differences of over 1 m in the sea-ice thickness in the central Arctic. Another example is the trends in the September sea-ice extent, with one ensemble member showing an even larger negative trend in the September sea-ice extent over 1981–2005 than observed, while two ensemble members show a very small and not statistically significant trend over the same period. This highlights that it is important to compare the observational records not just with the ensemble mean, but also with individual ensemble members, due to the strong imprint of natural variability.</p>

members is shown by the shaded area, with individual ensemble members shown as thin blue lines. To show the spread
in the satellite data due to the use of different retrieval algorithms, we plotted the NSIDC sea-ice extent from Fetterer
et al. (2002) as solid red line and the bootstrap sea-ice extent calculated from the sea-ice concentrations from Comiso
1999 as dashed red line. The sea-ice extent is calculated as the area with a sea-ice concentration of 15% or more, and in
the satellite data gap around the North Pole the area is assumed to be covered by at least 15% at all times.</p>

<p>Landrum, L., M. M. Holland, D. P. Schneider, and E. Hunke, 2011: Antarctic sea ice climatology, variability and late 20th- Century change in CCSM4. J. Climate (in revision).</p>

<p>The mean modeled Antarctic Sea Ice concentration (SIC) is too extensive 
in all months compared to late 20th Century observations, the mean 
modeled ice cover in CCSM4 is too extensive (Figure a). This is in part 
related to excessively strong westerly winds over ~50°S-60°S, which 
drive a large equatorward meridional ice transport and enhanced ice 
growth near the
continent. In spite of these biases in the climatology, the model’s sea 
ice variability compares well to observations (Figure b). The leading 
mode of austral winter sea ice concentration exhibits a dipole structure 
with anomalies of opposite sign in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors. 
These anomalies are related to the timing of ice advance and retreat, 
are transported eastward with the mean ocean currents, and reoccur over 
subsequent years due to an imprint of the seasonal ice anomalies on 
surface ocean conditions. Both the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) project onto the leading mode of sea ice 
variability and contribute to a significant spectral peak at about four 
years.</p>
