I am fairly new to modeling and coding so I am really looking forward to this workshop to learn more about it!

My research involves using a one-dimensional energy balance model to simulate the equilibrium climate response of extrasolar planets around F-, G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. However, the inherent simplicity of the energy balance model calls for more complex modeling for more robust results and so utilizing a global climate model such as CESM would be the natural next step in my research. Other topics that I’m interested in are the study of biosignatures and extremophiles and would love to network with anyone else in this realm. Outside of research, I love playing video and board games, swimming, boxing, biking, and playing the ukulele when I have the chance. I am also into anime/manga and I am a total geek for several franchises, including Marvel and Star Wars, and absolutely love the Flash.

Broadly, my research interests center around reconstructing Earth’s climate history through the lens of the ocean using sand-grain-sized fossil shells buried in marine sediments. The geochemistry of these shells, formed by small zooplankton called “foraminifera”, preserve a history of ocean temperature, continental ice volume, water mass configuration, and many other important features that allow paleoceanographers such as myself to refine how the ocean initiates, perpetuates, and/or responds to global climate change. While completing my Master’s degree in Norfolk, VA, USA, my research primarily focused on reconstructing the strength of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation over the last 25,000 years to resolve its response to the naturally abrupt climate events that characterize the planet’s last deglaciation. Now, I am working on newly-recovered sediment cores from the Indian and Southern Oceans to investigate the role the ocean played in the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide as the planet transitioned out of the last ice age. Outside of the lab, you can catch me at the beach or in the mountains. I’m also a bit of a bibliophile attempting to build a personal library.</p>

Presently, there is little (if any) subsurface ocean current data assimilated into hurricane models in real-time. We are currently developing a system to process data from an acoustic doppler current profiler mounted on a Teledyne-Webb Research Slocum glider in real-time. This system will enable the investigation of both process-based and data assimilation improvements for hurricane forecast models. While I hope to contribute to the improvement of forecast models in a near-real time frame, I am also very interested in hurricane modeling in the context of longer time frames and in the context of our changing climate. A better understanding of how hurricanes are predicted to evolve in space and time with different climate projection scenarios would be valuable information for city planners, insurance companies, private citizens, and many others. I am excited by the prospect of being able to use CESM in this context and contribute to this effort. In my free time, I am an avid beer brewer, chocolate addict, and puppy enthusiast.</p>

In recent work, I found that inter-model spread of hemispherically symmetric components of zonal-mean tropical precipitation pattern can be linked to the inter-model differences in water vapor shortwave absorptivity using CMIP models. To check this hypothesis, I changed the water vapor shortwave absorptivity in CAM radiative transfer scheme and found that water vapor shortwave absorptivity can indeed strengthen the tropical cold tongue structure thereby diverges the precipitation off the equator. Now, I’m interested in the uncertainties of tropical Pacific climate patterns, especially focusing on linkages with the cloud biases over the Southern Hemipshere extratropics. By analyzing the experimental results (ETIN-MIP) where the insolation in 8 climate models over the Southern Hemisphere extratropics is reduced, I confirm the remote impacts on tropical Pacific and understand the robust mechanism. The additional ensemble and the regional cloud locking experiments with CESM1-CAM5 have facilitated the analysis.

									<p class="mb-0 small media-text hide-me" id="lednytskyy-b">Dr. Lednyts'kyy is a project scientist in Environmental Physics at University of Greifswald in Germany. His research interests center around remote sensing and atmospheric chemistry. His early research focused on the optimization of the retrieval of emission profiles used in a chemical model developed including the quintet excited state of dioxygen and other trace components to derive atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere. He validated model calculations using data with various levels of self-consistency: data measured in situ or data obtained using different techniques. Currently, his research focuses on chemistry modeling of trace gases in the mesosphere and the stratosphere. He is also interested in quantification of uncertainty and sensitivity of derived trace gases to understand sources of uncertainty in models. He holds a specialist degree in Geology from National Mining University of Ukraine, a Dipl.-Phys. degree in Physics from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, and a doctoral degree in Physics from University of Greifswald in Germany. He investigated hydrology and ecology of the Crimean Sea Syvash during his graduate work in Ukraine, and state modeling using Hidden Markov Chains and other statistical approaches during his graduate work in Germany. When not trying to assimilate data, he enjoys hiking.</p>

He is interested in the vegetation coupling with physical climate, hydrology, and biogeochemical cycle. He uses the Earth system model, satellite data, and ground observations to study the climate impacts and feedbacks in the Earth system. Yue’s current research work relates to the biophysical and biogeochemical climate effects of tropical deforestation. During his Ph.D., he published a series of papers that systematically assess the biophysical temperature & hydrological effects of afforestation and vegetation greening in China, where the largest ecological project has been performed in the world. His research interests broadly involve land-atmosphere coupling, global energy balance, hydrological and biogeochemical cycles.

I am interested in understanding mechanisms controlling ocean biogeochemical cycles and their sensitivity to future changes. During my Ph.D., I worked on understanding the ocean iron dynamics using ocean biogeochemistry models. For my postdoc, I evaluate the impact of bacteria on ocean biogeochemistry and explore how bacteria respond to future changes. I spend my free time going to museums, reading books on fiction and philosophy in Vietnamese, English, and just recently, in French.</p>

My name is Tim van den Akker, I am a Dutch PhD candidate at the Utrecht University and I work together with the NCAR to improve CISM (now I am mainly focussed on testing new basal sliding laws), and eventually I will try to model ice - ocean interactions between CISM and MOM6. In my spare time I like to be outside as much as possible, doing various kinds of sport like obstacle course running, cycling, climbing, hiking and camping. I furthermore enjoy cooking a lot, with the real Italian pizza as my specialty, I brew craft beers and play guitar in a rock band. I look forward to meeting you all during the workshops!</p>

His research interests center around remote sensing and atmospheric chemistry. His early research focused on the optimization of the retrieval of emission profiles used in a chemical model developed including the quintet excited state of dioxygen and other trace components to derive atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere. He validated model calculations using data with various levels of self-consistency: data measured in situ or data obtained using different techniques. Currently, his research focuses on chemistry modeling of trace gases in the mesosphere and the stratosphere. He is also interested in quantification of uncertainty and sensitivity of derived trace gases to understand sources of uncertainty in models. He holds a specialist degree in Geology from National Mining University of Ukraine, a Dipl.-Phys. degree in Physics from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, and a doctoral degree in Physics from University of Greifswald in Germany. He investigated hydrology and ecology of the Crimean Sea Syvash during his graduate work in Ukraine, and state modeling using Hidden Markov Chains and other statistical approaches during his graduate work in Germany. When not trying to assimilate data, he enjoys hiking.</p>
